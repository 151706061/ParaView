# This test verifies that default proxy properties do not show up in the trace.
#
# For this test, we will use the clip's ClipType, which is a proxy property.
#
# If the ClipType is set to `Plane`, which is the default, it should not
# appear in the trace. If a property of the Plane is modified, however, that
# modification should still appear in the trace.
#
# If a clip's ClipType is set to `Sphere` instead, which is not the default,
# it should appear in the trace.
#
# Unfortunately, I had to use `smstate.get_state()` for this test instead of
# a regular Python trace, because we want to verify that modifications to
# default proxy properties still show up in the trace, and you cannot track
# changes to proxies after they are initialized in a regular trace due to this
# issue:
# https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/-/issues/22940
