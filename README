This document provides some basic details on how to get ParaView-CAVE up and running on your system.

IMPORTANT: Please clone VTK-CAVE. Copy the contents of VTK-CAVE into ParaView/VTK directory. VTK-CAVE contains the changes done in VTK for CAVE support.

1. Required Packages:
  1.1 VRPN (http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/vrpn/obtaining_vrpn.html as of today Sept 08 2010, we were using master branch of git clone).
  1.2 libxt-dev
  1.3 g++ (4.4.3 or newer)
  1.4 libstdc++-dev
  1.5 QT 4.6.2 or 4.6.3 (earlier or later versions won't work as of now).
  1.6 Install mpich2 (from your distribution repository).

2. Dowload the the source code:

3. Instruction when compiling with cmake:
  3.1 Provide path to VRPN include
  3.2 Provide path for libvrpn.a including the name itself.


Here are the steps to compile and run the application.

( Prerequisites: MPI, VRPN Server, Qt, CMake)
----------------------------------------------------------
1.  Download
  # git clone git@github.com:nixz/ParaView-CAVE.git
<<<<<<< HEAD
  # cd ParaView-CAVE
  # git submodule update --init
=======
  # git clone git@github.com:nixz/VTK-CAVE.git
  # rmdir ParaView-CAVE/VTK
  # mv VTK-CAVE/ ParaView-CAVE/VTK
>>>>>>> updating readme

2. Make a build directory
  # mkdir build
  # cd build

3. Build with cmake
  # ccmake ../ParaView-CAVE

Configuration Steps:
-> enable BUILD_SHARED_LIB
-> enable PARAVIEW_USE_MPI
-> set include dir path in VRPN_INCLUDE_DIR
-> set the library name in VRPN_LIBRARY (note: if library is not in standard paths then provide /complete/path/libvrpn.a)

Once done -> configure (type 'c'). If everything is okay -> generate (option shows up , type 'g' to generate)

  # make -j 8

4. Run the server  (6 processes each driving one display in the cave. Change the number of process according to the number of displays)
   note ParaView-CAVE/cave.pvx is the configuration file
  # cd bin
  # mpiexec -np 6 ./pvserver  ../../ParaView-CAVE/cave.pvx

5. Open another terminal to  run the client. (note: this client connects to the server which open up 6 windows according to the config given in cave.pvx)
  # cd path/to/build/bin
<<<<<<< HEAD
  FOR VRPN do the following
  # PV_ICET_WINDOW_BORDERS=1 ./paraview --stereo --stereo-type=Anaglyph --server=localhost --vrpn --vrpn-address=Tracker0@localhost
  For VRUI do the following
  # PV_ICET_WINDOW_BORDERS=1 ./paraview --stereo --stereo-type=Anaglyph --server=localhost --vrui --vrui-address=localhost
=======
  # PV_ICET_WINDOW_BORDERS=1 ./paraview --stereo --stereo-type=Anaglyph --server=localhost
>>>>>>> updating readme

Note:  PV_ICET_WINDOW_BORDERS=1 disables the full screen and instead opens up a 400x400 window. Remove this environment variable to work in full screen mode

6. To get more stereo options see
 # ./paraview --help
