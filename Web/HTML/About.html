    <font size=5>ParaView </font> is an extensible, open-source visualization systen
    designed for parallel computing environments. ParaView is built on the open-source
    <a href="http://www.visualizationtoolkit.org">VTK</a> software. It uses data
    streaming to process large datasets, supports parallel implementations of common
    algorithms, and uses parallel tree-composite rendering for a completely parallel
    solution.
    <p>
    <u><b>Typical Usage</b></u><br>
    The following figure illustrates the key features of ParaView. The GUI is
    divided into the following parts:
    <ul>
    <li>menu bar</li>
    <li>display window</li>
    <li>tabbed notebook GUI</li>
    <li>message area</li>
    <li>progress bar</li>
    <li>frame rate control</li>
    </ul>

    <div align="center">
    <img src="/ParaView/Art/LabeledScreenShot.jpg" border=0 alt="">
    </div>
    <p>
    The menu bar is used to load data, save, and exit the system. The interactive
    display window is where 3D renderings are placed. The tabbed notebook area 
    provides a GUI to the currectly selected feature, filter, or processing
    option. The message area communicates information about the state of the
    system such as x-y selected pixel location, data values, and so on. When
    time consuming operations are initiated, the progress bar indicated relative
    completion of the operation using a horizontal bar chart. The level of 
    interactivity can be controlled by adjusting the frame rate control. The
    frame rate control trades off rendering speed versus image fidelity.

    <u><b>The Origins of ParaView</b></u><br> 
    ParaView is being developed as part of a three-year contract awarded to
    Kitware, Inc. by a consortium of three National Labs: - Los Alamos,
    Sandia, and Livermore. The goal of the project is to develop scalable
    parallel processing tools with an emphasis on distributed memory
    implementations. The project includes parallel algorithms,
    infrastructure, I/O, support, and display devices. In addition, the
    turn-key application ParaView is being developed as part of this
    contract. One significant feature of the contract is that all software
    developed is to be delivered open source. Hence ParaView is available
    as an open-source system.
