    <font size=5>Download </font>ParaView via CVS access. To use ParaView,
    you will also have to download and install VTK and CMake. (VTK serves 
    as the visualization engine; CMake is the build environment.) There is 
    currently no method to obtain ParaView as a packaged zip or tar file. 
    Packaged releases will become available in the near future.
    <p>
    (Note: CVS is a source code revision control system used by many participants 
    in the open-source community. To use CVS, you must have it installed on your 
    system. You may wish to use the 
    <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">Cygwin</a> tools on Windows
    platforms, or <a href="http://www.wincvs.org">WinCVS</a> which provides 
    a very nice GUI to CVS.
    <p>
    The current version of ParaView requires that you use the new VTK source 
    tree and CMake build environment. (These changes are to be realized with the
    release of VTK 4.0 in late 2001.) Do not use VTK 3.3 or earlier versions.

    <u><b>CMake</b></u> can be obtained via CVS using the following procedure.
    <p>
    <b>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@public.kitware.com:/CMake/cvsroot login</b><br>
    (respond with password cmake)
    <p>
    Follow this command by checking out the source code:<br>
    <b>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@public.kitware.com:/CMake/cvsroot co CMake</b>
    <p>
    If you are on a Windows system, CMake can also be downloaded and installed
    using the self-extraction distribution found 
    <a href="http://public.kitware.com/CMake/CMSetup.exe">here</a>.

    <u><b>VTK</b></u> can be obtained via CVS using the following procedure.
    <p>
    <b>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.visualizationtoolkit.org:/vtk/cvsroot login</b><br>
    (respond with password vtk)
    <p>
    Follow this command by checking out the source code:<br>
    <b>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.visualizationtoolkit.org:/vtk/cvsroot co VTK</b>
    <p>
    (Be careful that you don't check the new VTK CVS repository on top of an existing
    VTK 3.3 or earlier release. Remember, in Windows "vtk" and "VTK" are the same 
    directory name.)
