XArrayCFReader Plugin

This plugin needs the xarray python package not shipped with the ParaView binary. You'll need to create a python environment in a directory DIR using:

cd DIR
uv venv --python 3.12

where 3.12 is the version of Python used by ParaView (see Help / About and change that version if needed) and then install xarray in that environment with:

source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install xarray netcdf4 cftime cfgrib zarr h5netcdf
deactivate

After that, you can start ParaView using:

paraview --venv DIR/.venv

See 'Interactive Visualization of scientific data using VTK-XArray interoperability' blog post for more information about this plugin.
