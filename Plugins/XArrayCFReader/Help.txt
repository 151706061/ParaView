XArrayCFReader Plugin

This plugin needs the xarray python module which is not shipped with the ParaView binary.

If you are building ParaView yourself, please ensure it is installed in the python you are building against.

If not, a solution is to create a python environment in a directory DIR using:

cd DIR
uv venv --python VERSION

where VERSION is the version of Python used by ParaView (please see Help / About for the current version) and then install xarray in that environment with:

source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install xarray netcdf4 cftime cfgrib zarr h5netcdf
deactivate

After that, you can start ParaView using:

paraview --venv DIR/.venv

See 'Interactive Visualization of scientific data using VTK-XArray interoperability' blog post for more information about this plugin.

Another solution (which directly uses the ParaView's python binary) is to install the xarray python module using your system pip, as described here:
