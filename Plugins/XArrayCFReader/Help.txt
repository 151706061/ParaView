XArrayCFReader Plugin

This plugin needs the xarray python module which is not shipped with the ParaView binary.

If you are building ParaView yourself, please ensure it is installed in the python you are building against.

If not, a solution is to create a python environment in a directory DIR using:

cd DIR
uv venv --python VERSION

where VERSION is the version of Python used by ParaView (please see Help / About for the current version) and then install xarray in that environment
making sure you match the version of all relevant python packages included with the ParaView binary (run bin/pvpython -m paraview.apps.packages to see
those versions).

source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install xarray cftime cfgrib zarr h5netcdf "numpy==1.26.4" "pandas==2.0.3" "netcdf4==1.6.5"
deactivate

After that, you can start ParaView using:

paraview --venv DIR/.venv

Another solution (which directly uses the ParaView's python binary) is to install the xarray python module using your system pip, as described here:
