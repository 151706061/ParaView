ParaView's Python documentation!
===========================================

ParaView offers rich scripting support through Python. This support is available
as part of the ParaView client (paraview), an MPI-enabled batch application
(pvbatch), the ParaView python client (pvpython), or any other Python-enabled

visualization engine.
