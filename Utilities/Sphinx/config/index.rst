Welcome to ParaView's Python documentation!
===========================================

ParaView offers rich scripting support through Python. This support is available
as part of the ParaView client (paraview), an MPI-enabled batch application
(pvbatch), the ParaView python client (pvpython), or any other Python-enabled
application. Using Python, users and developers can gain access to the ParaView
engine called **Server Manager**.
