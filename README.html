<h1><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<font size=5>Welcome</font> to ParaView, an open-source, multi-platform, 
parallel scientific  visualization application. Although it can be run on 
a single processor,  ParaView is specifically designed to run on distributed 
parallel computers. ParaView has been succesfully tested on Windows and Linux 
workstations, clusters and SGI Origin 2000 systems. ParaView is a turnkey 
application  written using the  <a href="http://www.visualizationtoolkit.org">
Visualization Toolkit</a> and it has a framework based on a unique blend of 
Tcl/Tk and C++. 
<p>
<font size=5>ParaView </font> is an extensible, open-source visualization system
designed for parallel computing environments. It is built on the open-source
<a href="http://www.visualizationtoolkit.org">VTK</a> software. It uses data
streaming to process large datasets, supports parallel implementations of common
algorithms, and uses parallel tree-composite rendering for a completely parallel
solution.
<p>

<u><b><a name="Origins">The Origins of ParaView</a></b></u><br> 
ParaView is being developed as part of a three-year contract awarded to
Kitware, Inc. by a consortium of three National Labs:  Los Alamos,
Sandia, and Livermore. The goal of the project is to develop scalable
parallel processing tools with an emphasis on distributed memory
implementations. The project includes parallel algorithms,
infrastructure, I/O, support, and display devices. In addition, the
turn-key application, ParaView, is being developed as part of this
contract. One significant feature of the contract is that all software
developed is to be delivered open source. Hence ParaView is available
as an open-source system.
<p>
<u><b><a name="Features">Features</a></b></u><br> 
The following summarizes the important features
of ParaView:
  <p>
  <u><b>Software Architecture</b></u>
      <ul>
      <li>Open-source</li>
      <li>Uses C++ to drive the Tk widget set.</li>
      <li>Portable across Windows and Unix systems</li>
      <li>Built on the standard open-source VTK visualization system</li>
      <li>Modular GUI may be extended to support your own tools</li>
      <li>The application may be extended at run-time via Tcl scripting</li>
      <li>Transparent multi-processor support</li>
      <li>Supports data-streaming. (Has been used to process 1-pedabyte data in a
          single run on a 2048 processor machine.)</li>
      <li>VTK or user-defined filters can be easily added.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
  <u><b>Visualization Capabilities</u></b>
      <ul>
      <li>Reads and writes a variety of data formats including EnSight, VTK, Plot3D, 
          Wavefront, STL, etc.</li>
      <li>Supports several source objects (e.g., lines, planes, spheres, implicit functions,
          point clouds, etc.) used for probing, generating streamlines,
          cutting, and representing geometry.</li>
      <li>A large library of visualization filters are available. These include isocontouring,
          cutting, clipping, color mapping, decimation, outlines, geometry extraction and glyphing.</li>
      <li>Supports different interaction styles, switchable at run-time. Users can add their
          own interaction styles.</li> 
      <li>Annotation features such as scalar bars; 2D (fixed) and 3D (moves with object) 
          text are available.</li>
      <li>Picking</li>
      <li>LOD displays allows for user trade-off between rendering fidelity and frame rate.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
  <u><b>Parallel Processing</u></b>
      <ul>
      <li>Supports parallel software rendering (tree composite with LOD)</li>
      <li>Algorithms implemented in parallel</li>
      <li>Data parallelism is supported</li>
      <li>Supports MPI and shared memory architectures</li>
      </ul>

<h1><A NAME="Compiling">Compiling ParaView Complete</a></h1>
This distribution of ParaView contains ParaView, VTK and Tcl/Tk 8.2.3. You
do not have to download VTK or Tcl/Tk separately to compile. However, if you
want to use your own VTK, you should not use this distribution. Instead, use
the ParaView distribution which does not contain VTK.
<p>
<b><font size=3>Install CMake</font></b><br>
To use ParaView, you will have to download and install CMake which is a
build configuration utility.
<p>
<u><b>CMake</b></u> can be obtained from <a href="http://public.kitware.com/CMake">http://public.kitware.com/CMake</a>. See CMake documentation for installation
instructions.
<p>

Next, <b><font size=3>build </font></b> ParaView differently depending on the
operating system:
<p>
<b><font size=3>Run CMake and Compile</font></b><br>
Once CMake is installed, you are ready to build VTK and ParaView. We highly
recommend reading the CMake documentation if you are not familiar with CMake:
<a href = "http://public.kitware.com/CMake/HTML/Documentation.html">http://public.kitware.com/CMake/HTML/Documentation.html</a>.
(You can skip the Developer's Guide if you are not going to work with
CMakeLists files.)
In summary, ParaView Complete build consists of:<ol>
<li> Running one of the CMake user interfaces </li>
<li> Changing configuration options  </li>
<li> Compiling (make on Unix, Visual Studio on Windows)</li>
</ol>

On Windows, you should use the CMakeSetup.exe application to setup
the VTK and ParaView build. On Unix/Linux, you should use the CMake wizard
(cmake -i) or the terminal interface (ccmake). See the CMake documentation
for details.
<p>
ParaView Complete is designed such that all the default build options
selected by CMake for VTK and ParaView are appropriate for building ParaView.
However you might have to tell CMake the location of some include files and
libraries (for example MPI libraries if you enabled MPI support).

<h3>Unix Installation</h3><p>
The following instructions only apply to UNIX systems.  

First we will give you the quick and dirty way to build ParaView Complete:
<p>
<pre>
  1) untar the ParaView Complete distribution
  2) cd ParaViewComplete
  4) cmake -i (run cmake in wizard mode, where you have to answer questions about the build)
or
  4) ccmake (run the terminal based interface to cmake where you interactively change build options)
  5) if necessary change build options
  6) make
</pre>

It is a very good idea to tell cmake what C and C++ compilers
you will be using. This can avoid many build problems.
On most systems you can pass this information to configure in the 
following way:
<pre>
env CXX=/your/C++/compiler CC=/your/c/compiler cmake
</pre>
otherwise you must set CXX and CC in your environment and then
run ccmake (or cmake -i).<p>

If you are planning to build ParaView for multiple architectures then you can
either make a copy of the entire ParaView tree for each architecture and then
follow the instructions above. Or you can have one copy of
the ParaView tree and compile it in a different manner (out-of-source). Instead of
running cmake from the ParaViewComplete directory, create a new directory where
you have some free disk space (not in the ParaViewComplete tree), a possible name
would be paraview-solaris. cd into this directory and then run cmake similar to the
following example:
<pre>
  ls /home/joe_user
      ParaViewComplete paraview-solaris paraview-sgi

  cd paraview-solaris
  ccmake /home/joe_user/ParaViewComplete
  or
  cmake -i /home/joe_user/ParaViewComplete
</pre>
This will create makefiles in the paraview-solaris directory.  Then you can run
make in paraview-solaris to compile ParaView Complete.  Repeat this process for
each architecture you wish to build.<p>

<h3>Windows Installation</h3><p>
    The Windows build process uses the CMake GUI CMakeSetup. Then you use the 
    compiler make utility to compile as follows.
  <pre>
  1) Install ParaView Complete distribution by unzipping into the appropriate
     directory.

  2) Execute CMakeSetup. This will pop-up a little
     GUI that allows you to tailor the build. It then starts
     building .dsw and .dsp files for Microsoft, or makefiles for Borland.
     You'll have to tell CMakeSetup where you've placed your ParaViewComplete
     source code, and where to build the object code and dll's (we'll call it
     "paraviewbin").

  3) When CMakeSetup completes, start up msdev and load ParaViewComplete.dsw.
     Select ALL_BUILD project, and build it.

</pre>
We recommend a 300MByte minimum swap size or you might have trouble
during the link phase.<p>
