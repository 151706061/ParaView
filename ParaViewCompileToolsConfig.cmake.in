# ParaViewCompileToolsConfig.cmake - ParaView compile tools configuration file
# for cross compiling.
#
# This file simply imports the VTKCompileToolsConfig.cmake file. We provide this
# wrapper so that ParaView project can indeed require users to point to a file
# that is named ParaView....cmake rather than VTK....cmake

# Remember cross compiling is not supported from "installed" version of the
# host-tools, one has to point to the build-directory.
