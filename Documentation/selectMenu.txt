Select Menu

<insert selectMenu.jpg>

The Select menu is a list of the data sources that have been created (and not deleted) in ParaView.  Clicking on an item in the Select menu makes that source the currently active one.  It updates the navigation window to show this, and it makes the user interface for this source visible.  This menu is particularly useful if you have created multiple pipelines (starting from different data sets, for example) in ParaView.
