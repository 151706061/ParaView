<p>
The navigation window is a graphical representation of the pipeline
structure used in ParaView.  Items are added to the pipeline as the user
loads or modifies data.  The name of the currently active data source is
drawn in black and is centered in the navigation frame.  (When new filters
are added to the pipeline, the current data -- associated with the current
source -- will be passed through that filter.  This is true even if the
current source is somewhere in the middle of the pipeline.)  The names of
the sources directly before and directly after this source are displayed in
blue and are connected by arrows to the name of the current source.  If
there are more sources in the pipeline that are not currently represented
in the navigation frame, an elipsis (...) is drawn on the corresponding end
of the navigation frame.  Clicking on the source names displayed in blue
will 1) make that source active and 2) bring up the user interface
corresponding to that source.

Note: Only sources at the end of the pipeline can be removed from the
pipeline.  This is done by clicking the "Delete" button on the Parameters
page associated with that source.

See also the Select menu documentation.
