The Select menu is a list of the data sources that have been created (and
not deleted) in ParaView.  Clicking on an item in the Select menu makes
that source the currently active one.  It updates the navigation window to
show this, and it makes the user interface for this source visible.  This
menu is particularly useful if you have created multiple pipelines
(starting from different data sets, for example) in ParaView.
