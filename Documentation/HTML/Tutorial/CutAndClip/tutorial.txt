1. Start ParaView (see <link> for information on how to launch ParaView)

2. Create a Plot3D file reader by selecting PLOT3DReader from VTK -> Sources
   menu. Click Browse next to the XYZFileName entry and locate combxyz.bin
   in the ParaView data directory. Next, click Browse next to the QFileName
   entry and locate combq.bin in the data directory. Click accept.

3. Rotate the camera around the cursor until you see the outline of the
   combustor from the front. Zoom in until the outline occupies almost
   the whole window.

4. Push the Cut button on the toolbar.

5. Create different cut planes by changing the plane normal (clicking on
   the "X Normal", "Y Normal", "Z Normal" and "Use Camera Normal" buttons). 
   You can also change the center of the plane  using the x, y and z entries
   for center point.

6. Next let's use the Clip utility. Remove the cut filter by clicking on
   Delete. Now create an isosurface of density (use a value of 0.3) 
   (see the IsoSurface tutorial for details on how to create contours).
   To clip the isosurface, click on the Clip button on the toolbar.
   Push Accept to use the default clip values (plane normal is in the
   positive z direction and the center is the center of the bounds).
   Note the direction of the clip can be changed by changing the sign of
   the normal. Experiment with different plane normals and center positions.
