FAQ:

Why do my wire frames look funny?
	Wire frames are shaded.  This will be changed in the next release.



Where are the scalars/vectors I expect?
	The array may not have a name. ParaView does not recognize attributes without names.  VTK is being converted so that all data arrays are named.



What does "Save Data" entry in the file menu do when you are running more than one process?
     When running one process, "Save Data" creates a vtk file from the current data set in ParaView.  When running more than one process, save data creates a pvtk file.  Each process writes its own data in a vtk file.  A file with the pvtk extension is created to list the separate parts.  The pvtk file can be loaded into ParaView like any other file.


Why can't I change the filename on my reader? 
    Once a ParaView data set is created,  it is assigne a vtk dataset type (i.e vtkPolyData).  This cannot be changed.  Since changing the file name of a reader could change the output type, we do not allow it.  You have to load other data as an separated data object.



Why can't I find the filters I want.
    Some filters like vtkStreamLines do not currently have a parallel implementation. Others have unusual methods that are not currenly defined in the XML interface descriptions.  We are working to include these filters in future releases.  Some fitlers have just been left out because we wanted to keep the menu of filters short.  You can easily add these filters to ParaView by adding an XML description in the XML source file.




How can I move my dataset relative to another data set.
    Transform fiters are not yet supported in ParaView.  Also, there is no access to an actors position and orientation.



Why is rotation acting like translation.
    If the center of rotation is far away from the current view, then rotation acts like translation.  Just press the reset button in the center of rotation toolbar.



Can I use volume rendering to see my data.
    Volume rendering an transparencey are not yet supported in ParaView.



Why does my scalar bar keep disappearing.
    To avoid confusion with multiple scalar bars, only the current data object can have a visible color map bar.  When you select another data object, the color bar visiblity is turned off.




What is the difference between vtkShrink and vtkShrinkPolyData?
     vtkShrink works on any data type, and always produces unstructured grid output.  vtkShrinkPolyData only takes poly data input, and produces poly data output.






How do I show the surface of my volume.  Setting the Surface/wirframe option does nothing.
    ParaView is currently setup to show 3D volume data sets as wire frames.  Selecting "Surface" in the data page will have no effect.  If you want to see the surface, use the "vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter" in the VTK-Filters menu.





Which readers/filters work in parallel.
      Currently there are only a few of readers that truly work in parallel.  vtkImageReader, vtkPOPReader, vtkPDataSetReader and vtkParticle reader all work in parallel.  vtkDataSetReader does not.  For doemsnistration purposes, ParaView will distribute pieces of a data set when the reader cannot.  Unfortunatley, this is an inefficient process.
      All the filters in ParaView will work in parallel.  Some like vtkCleanPolyData have global agorithms that when run in parallel will produce seems.  Others like vtkLoopSubdivisionFilter and vtkGeoemetryFilter have algorithms that work on local neighoods of cells.  These filters can operate in parallel with no seems (result invarience) if their input can generate ghost cells.  Otherwise, there may noticible boundaries between pieces handled by the different processes.




Can ParaView stream my data sets (process then out-of-core).
    VTK has some useful streaming features that allow you to process a large data set without ever having to load the entire data set into memory.  ParaView has not yet been set up to take advantage of theis VTK feature.  I would suggest creating a visualization in ParaView using a smaller/lower resultion data set.  You couls then save out the pipelin into a Tcl script, add a streaming filter and use VTK to process the large data set. 




Why does it take so long to read my files in parallel.
    If you are running on multiple processes and are using a reader that cannot read in parallel, you will pay a penalty.  The default behavior is that every process will read all of the data an throw away the pieces it does not need.  Since every process is trying to read the file at the same time, you may have file contention.  There is an option in ParaView that help this situation, but it still has a couple of issues. When the environment variable "PV_USE_TRANSMIT" is set to "True" (or any value), then ParaView will read the file on the first process, and will distribute the pieces using MPI calls.  This is much efficient because only the first process reads the file.  Unfortunaly, ther is a remote chance that ParaView might hang because of a deadlock.




I cannot see my data, what do I do?
  You can pres the reset-view button at the top left corner of the application.  This will change the view to best display all of the visible data.  You can also press the "Change View to Show Data" button on the individual data objects "Display" pages.  This will change the view to show the data in that individual data object. 




Why isn't streamlines in the list of VTK filters.
    We have not yet created an interface to set the starting location of the streamlines.  This filter will be available in future releases.




How do I add my own vtk filter/reader to paraview?





What do all the sources and fitlers in the VTK menus do? 





How is my data partitioned across processes.
    You may notice seems in the LOD version of the data when you are interactively rotating the view.  These show the paratition between the different processes.  For a better display of processor assignment, you can use the "vtkPieceScalars" filter int he VTK-Filter menu.  This will assign each process a different color.
