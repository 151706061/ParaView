## Implicit Cone Widget
Expose a new widget representing a one-sided infinite cone, parameterized by an axis, and angle between the sides of the cone and its axis, and an origin point. Users can manipulate the widget through controls similars to the cylinder widget ones.
Its underlying cone can be used in any filter relying on implicit functions (i.e. Clip).
