## Add new options to the VTKJS Exporter

New options have been added to the VTKJS Scene exporter. You can now choose whether to also create a standalone Glance viewer embedding the scene. The HTML template can now be retrieved automatically from the ParaView share directory from the install folder. It is now also possible to toggle network access from Glance, to make the page independent from external servers.
