## Add support for removing layers when growing selection

Two new render view settings have been added
to control whether or not to remove layers when growing selection.
Remove seed control whether to remove the initial selection seed to grow from.
Remove intermediate control whether to remove the intermediate selection layers when growing selection.
When enabling both, only the last layer is shown.
