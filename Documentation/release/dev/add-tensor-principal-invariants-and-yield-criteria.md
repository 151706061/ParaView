## Add Tensor Principal Invariants and Yield Criteria filters

The new `Tensor Principal Invariants` filter computes principal values and vectors
from 2D and 3D symmetric tensors (described with arrays containing 3 and 6
components, respectively). The vectors can be scaled with the principal values
if needed.

The new `Yield Criteria` filter computes different yield criteria from given
2D or 3D symmetric tensors.

Available yield criteria currently include:
- Tresca criterion
- Von Mises criterion
