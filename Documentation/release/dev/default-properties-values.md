## Default property values

### Restore User default

Alongside to the `Reset to Application Default` and `Use as Default`,
you can now find a new context menu entry to `Reset to User Settings`,
so even after manual modification, you can retrieve your own default.

Just right click on a property from the _Properties Panel_ to configure it!

### Restore without apply

You can `Restore application default settings value` on the  _Properties Panel_ before
the first apply, and doing so do not automatically apply anymore:
you fully control when apply occurs and may do manual modification before.
