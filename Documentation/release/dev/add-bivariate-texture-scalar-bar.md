## Add Bivariate Texture Scalar Bar

Add a dedicated 2D scalar bar to the Bivariate Texture Representation. This 2D scalar bar allows you to
visualize annotations (titles, ticks and labels) associated to the bivariate texture colors.
Unlike the standard scalar bar, this 2D scalar bar does not have an orientation, and is not attached to a
Lookup table (transfer function) but to the representation itself. However they have numerous properties
in common, as text font, border, background, and so on.
