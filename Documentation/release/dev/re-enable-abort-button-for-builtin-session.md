# Re-enable abort button for builtin session

You can now use the abort button to cancel long-running operations in ParaView. The abort button becomes active whenever the progress bar displays ongoing activity. This feature is currently available only in *builtin* sessions. Abort feature for *remote* sessions is not available.
