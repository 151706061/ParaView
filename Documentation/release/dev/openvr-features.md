# OpenVR new features

New features have been added to the OpenVR plugin:

- A new **Reset All Positions** has been added to reset positions
of objects that have been moved using the **Grab** mode
- A new **Pick** interaction is available that allows to grab objects far away with the ray
- A new checkbox **Interactive Ray** is available. When enabled, the ray becomes green when an
interaction with an object is possible and the ray is cut at the intersection.
