## Improve QuickLaunch window
To add filters (or sources or extractors), you can use the "Quick Launch" window (ctrl + space).
From this minimalist window you can now see the documentation and the requirements for the selected filter.
Moreover, you do not need anymore to know the filter actual name:
the window now also suggests filters based on their documentation!
