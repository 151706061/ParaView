## Add bivariate representations plugin

This plugin brings a new representation to visualize two point data arrays at the same time.
It uses Perlin noise to visualize the values of the 2nd array: the noise is stronger where the values are high.
Note that only scalar data can be chosen as noise array.
This representation can be used to visualize 2D and 3D surfacic data.
