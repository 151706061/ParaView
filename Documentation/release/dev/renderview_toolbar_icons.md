# Render view toolbar icons

* Icons in the render view toolbar were updated to SVG versions, so they can scale to any resolution.
* Other uses of .png icons are being replaced if possible.
* Icons changes are mostly documented in a [wiki page](https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/icons-rework/-/wikis/home)
