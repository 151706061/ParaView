# CAVE: Per-Display Hiding of 2D Overlays

You can now configure any display in your CAVE to show or hide the typical
2D overlays seen on the desktop.  This includes things like the scalar bar,
rendering annotation, etc.

By default all displays will show 2D overlays. To disable them on any display,
simply add a `Show2DOverlays="0"` attribute to any `Machine` element.
