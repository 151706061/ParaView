# Catalyst 2 Steering

Add steering capabilities to Catalyst 2, by implementing the `catalyst_results` method in ParaView Catalyst.

With steering, the users are now able to change simulation parameters through the ParaView Catalyst GUI. See `CxxSteeringExample` in `Examples/Catalyst2` folder for live example of the feature.
