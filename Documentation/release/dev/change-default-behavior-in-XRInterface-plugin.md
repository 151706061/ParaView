## Change default behavior in XRInterface plugin

The starting trigger action when launching XR mode has been changed from **Probe** to **Pick**.

Additionally, the starting orientation of the scene has been changed so that the
**View Up** direction is now **+Y**, which is more commonly used e.g. with skyboxes.
