# Support for Polyhedral elements in Catalyst V2

Catalyst Adaptor API V2 now supports polyhedral elements.
This is done by adding support for polyhedral elements
in `vtkConduitSource`. A new example, `CxxPolyhedra`, demonstrates
how to use Conduit Mesh Blueprint to communicate information about
polyhedral elements.
