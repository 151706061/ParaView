# zSpace plugin

A new Microsoft Windows only plugin named 'zSpace' has been added. It adds
a new view named 'zSpaceView' that let a user interact with a zSpace
device directly. This device is designed to work with Crystal Eyes
stereo, in full screen or in a cave display. The zSpace glasses
use a head tracking system that allow the user to look around 3D
object by moving his head.

This plugin requires a [zSpace System Software >= 4.4.2](https://support.zspace.com/s/article/zSpace-System-Software-release-Required?language=en_US),
and a SDK version >= 4.0.0.
It was tested on a zSpace 200 device but should be compatible with more recent devices as well.
