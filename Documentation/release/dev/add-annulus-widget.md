## Implicit Annulus Widget

The **Clip** and **Slice** filters now provide a new **Annulus** type. This new cut method represents two co-axial cylinders, infinite in both direction. You can manipulate the annulus in the view using the dedicated widget to control its axis, position, and inner/outer radii.
