## Quadric Decimation Filter

The **Quadric Decimation** Filter is now available. This filter can reduce the number of triangles in a triangulated mesh while preserving the shape of the mesh as much as possible. The targeted number of triangles reduction ratio is set by the user. While the previous **Decimation** Filter uses a vertex decimation approach with re-triangulation, the **Quadric Decimation** Filter uses edge collapses which tends to produce higher-quality results.
