## Add a Polarâ€¯Grid Annotation in RenderView

The RenderView has now a new annotation available: the Polar Grid.

Similar to the Polar Axes already existing the Representation level,
it allows to display axes and arcs, annotated with polar coordinates.

Like the Legend Grid, this new annotation is drawn in the screen space.
Thus, it is only available when `Camera Parallel Projection` is `On`.
