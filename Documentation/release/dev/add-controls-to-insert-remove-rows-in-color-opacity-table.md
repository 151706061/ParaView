## Add controls to insert and remove rows in the color opacity table in the _Color Map Editor_

The ParaView color opacity editor now shows controls to grow or shrink the color and opacity tables.

1. Clicking on the '+' button inserts a new row after the selected row with the values initialized to mid-point of the values in the selected row and the next row.
2. The '-' button can be used to remove all selected rows.
3. The 'x' button clears the table.

Note that the removal does not remove the first and last values for convenience.
