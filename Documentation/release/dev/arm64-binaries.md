# macOS arm64 Binaries

ParaView is now tested on the macOS arm64 platform.

Due to this change, ParaView binaries are now available using the processor
name according to the platform in the binary filename rather than a generic
"32Bit" or "64Bit" indicator.

Linux: `x86_64`
macOS: `arm64` and `x86_64`
Windows: `AMD64`
