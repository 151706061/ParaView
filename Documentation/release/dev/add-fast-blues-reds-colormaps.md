## New preset colormaps derived from Fast colormap

Two new preset colormaps, "Fast (Blues)" and "Fast (Reds)" have been added that extract the respective halves of the "Fast" colormap.
These colormaps may be useful for creating plots of values that are known to be either all-positive (e.g., von Mises stress) or all-negative values (e.g., change in temperature for a cooling object), while retaining visual consistency with the "Fast" colormap.
You can find these colormaps in the "Linear" preset list.
