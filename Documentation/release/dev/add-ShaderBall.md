## Add Shader ball to the Material Editor

The material editor now has a Shader ball to preview the current material. This allows
to edit quickly a lot of material without having to attach them on the scene, or even to
enable Ray tracing on the main render window.

The number of sample used for the shader ball can be customized to get the best
performance / quality ratio.
