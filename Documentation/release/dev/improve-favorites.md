# Improve Favorites

Some improvements have been made for favorites menu in open project window :

* Deleting the "-" button in favorites because it only removes the current directory and not the selected directory in favorites menu.

* You can remove multiple favorites by selecting multiple folders in favorites menu and using the delete shortcut (Suppr) or right click "Remove from favorites".

* You can now use a search bar to find a specific directory in favorites menu.
