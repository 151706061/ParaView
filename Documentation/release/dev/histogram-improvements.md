## Histogram filter improvements

The Histogram filter has been enhanced in several ways:

* Values from hidden points or cells are no longer included in the histogram results.
* The data range used for automatic bin range values now excludes hidden points and cells.
* A new option, **Normalize**, makes the filter produce normalized histogram values for applications where knowing the fraction of values that fall within each bin is desired.
