# Add a memory information in the status bar

Adds a progress bar in the status bar displaying the memory status of the server being the most used (in %).
This is close to what is displayed in the Memory Inspector but is intended to be more visible, to help the user see when a server has a high load.
With distributed, the displayed memory status is the most used one as the intent is for the user to be able to
be warned before a memory failure occurs.
