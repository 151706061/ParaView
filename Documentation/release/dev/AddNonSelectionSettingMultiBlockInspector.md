# Add a "Select On Click In Multi Block Inspector" setting in General/Miscellaneous

Turning off this setting changes the behavior of the MultiBlock Inspector (and potentially similar Widgets) so that clicks on blocks no longer selects them. When set to true, the default behavior of the MultiBlock Inspector is recovered.

# Change title of MultiBlock Inspector window

Change the name of the window from "Multi-block Inspector" to "MultiBlock Inspector".
