# Reverse the modifier key for screenshots

When clicking the screenshot capture button, a simple click now saves the screenshot to a file and a click with a modifier saves it to the clipboard, which is the opposite of what it was before, including the ParaView 5.9 release.

When saving a screenshot to the clipboard, the view now blinks.
