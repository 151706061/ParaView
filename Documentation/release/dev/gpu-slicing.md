# Volume Slicing with GPU

A new Volume representation property called `Blend Mode` has been added.\
This property replaces the old `Show Isosurface` property.\
Three blend modes are available:\
- *Composite*: This is the default volume rendering.
- *Isosurface*: This is the replacement of the old `Show Isosurface` property.
- *Slice*: This mode allows the configuration of a slice plane with an interactive widget.
