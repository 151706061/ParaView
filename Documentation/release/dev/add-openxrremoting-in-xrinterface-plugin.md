# Add OpenXR Remoting support in the XR Interface plugin

In the XR Interface plugin, it is now possible to stream the active render window
to a remote device with OpenXR.

Only grabbing interaction is available for now.

Note that, like in VTK, this feature currently only works with the **Hololens2**.

For more details about build instructions, the [XRInterface](../../../Plugins/XRInterface/README.md)
readme has been updated.
