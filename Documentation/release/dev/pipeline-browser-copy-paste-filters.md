# Copy and Paste filters in pipeline browser

`Copy Pipeline` and `Paste Pipeline` options added to the context and Edit menus, which allows filters to be copied and pasted to other items in the pipeline browser.
You can select a pipeline to be copied. When pasting the pipeline, ParaView checks that all filters to be pasted are valid for the type of data it is being pasted to.
