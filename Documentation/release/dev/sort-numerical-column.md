## Sort numerical columns in table properties

Perform actual numerical sort in table when using a numerical column, instead of the confusing
alphabetical sort (where `100` used to be put before `4`).

The impacted properties are those like the **Sets** properties of the **IOSS** reader
(known as **Array Selection** properties).
They are displayed as a 2 columns table, one column beeing a numerical Id.
