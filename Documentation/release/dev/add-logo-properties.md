## Add vtkLogoSourceRepresentation properties

You can now control how your logo's border is rendered.
* You can choose when to render a border (never, always, on hover).
* You can set border thickness and color.

You can now also set a scale that defines height relatively to screen size.
When 0 (by default), it's the same behavior than before. Otherwise, you
will keep a constant scale and won't be able to change it interactively.

You will now also have the border fitting the image (it's a bug fix).
