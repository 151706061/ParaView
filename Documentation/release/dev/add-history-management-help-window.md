## Add history management to help window

You can now navigate through the history of opened documentation pages in the ParaView Online Help window.
Four buttons had been added: go backward, go forward, go to home page, and save current page as home page.
All help window related classes are moved from the pqWidgets module to the pqComponents one in order to
access to pqSettings.
