## Implicit Frustum Widget

The **Clip** and **Slice** filters now provide a new **Frustum** type. This new cut method represents a 4-sided frustum, i.e. a pyramid with the top truncated perpendicularly to its axis, and infinite towards its far plane direction. You can manipulate the frustum in the view using the dedicated widget to control its position, orientation, vertical/horizontal angles and the position of its near plane.
