## Color legend background properties

Color legends may now have a background drawn behind the color legend components. The color and opacity of the background can be specified, as can padding around the color legend components and the edge of the background.

Additionally, an outline around the scalar bar can now be displayed. The scalar bar outline's color and thickness can be set via properties.

Properties for the new addition have been added to a new *Appearance* group in the *Edit Color Legend Properties* dialog. The previously existing properties controlling the thickness and length of the scalar bar have been added to this group as well.
