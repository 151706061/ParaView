# HyperTreeGrid in Gradient filter

The newly introduced vtkHyperTreeGridGradient is now available through the Gradient filter.
Simply call Gradient on a vtkHyperTreeGrid to use it.

This is a simple gradient computation based on an implicit dual. This behavior regarding cells of
different levels is still to be improved.
