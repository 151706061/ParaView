## Add new color map and palette

A new color map named ``Fast`` has been added.

Also ``Warm Gray Background`` has been renamed to ``Dark Gray Background``, and an new ``Warm Gray Background`` has been
added.

Additionally, the default color maps have been reordered to put the most useful ones first.

Finally, the new color map and palette will become the default in ParaView 5.13 release.

The picture below shows the new color map and palette compared to the current default color map and palette.
