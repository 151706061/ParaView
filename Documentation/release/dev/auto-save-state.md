## New Auto Save State Feature

ParaView has a new Auto Save State feature.

With the Auto Saveâ€¯State, a statefile will be written at each significant change in ParaView. This includes any pipeline modification or rendering property modification.

This feature can be enabled in the settings `Edit -> Settings...` (Off by default). You can also choose the statefile format (python or pvsm) and its location.
