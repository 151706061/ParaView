## Miscellaneous Settings reorganisation

For clarity sake, some settings in the Miscellaneous tab have been split in two,
IO and Represented Array.

As a user, it means that any settings you put in the `Default reader details`, `Reader Selection`,
`Allowed Readers` or `File dialog 'Location' variables` may be lost on upgrading.

You can either set them again using the settings menu or edit your settings file manually to correct the
settings proxy.
