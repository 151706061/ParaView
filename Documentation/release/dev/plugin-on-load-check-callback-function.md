# Plugin pre-load check

ParaView plugins can now specify a function that can be called and prevent loading it under certain conditions (for example if some resources are missing).

A new example has also been added to show how to use this feature. This example is inside `Examples/Plugins/OnLoadCheckCallback/`.
