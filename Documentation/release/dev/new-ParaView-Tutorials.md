## New ParaView Tutorials

ParaView has two types of tutorials. The ParaView Classroom Tutorials, are meant for following along with an instructor.
The ParaView Self-directed Tutorial has written guidance and background and can be followed independently.
Both tutorials are now part of the https://docs.paraview.org website. More specifically,
ParaView Classroom Tutorials have been moved from https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Classroom_Tutorials
to https://docs.paraview.org/en/latest/Tutorials/ClassroomTutorials/index.html, and ParaView Self-directed Tutorial
has been moved from a download link under Documentation on https://www.paraview.org/download/ to
https://docs.paraview.org/en/latest/Tutorials/SelfDirectedTutorial/index.html.
