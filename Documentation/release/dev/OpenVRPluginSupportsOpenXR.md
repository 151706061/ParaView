## OpenVR plugin now supports OpenXR

Users can now build the OpenVR plugin with optional support for OpenXR.  If the configure process finds both VR runtimes are available, the OpenVR dock panel will display a combo box allowing the user to choose which runtime to use when the "Send To VR" button is clicked.

This functionality has only been tested on Windows using SteamVR.
