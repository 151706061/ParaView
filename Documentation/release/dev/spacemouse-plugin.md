## Add SpaceMouseInteractor plugin, controlling the camera with a SpaceMouse

Using the 3DxWareSDK provided by 3Dconnexion, connect to a SpaceMouse
if it is available, and use it to manipulate the camera in the active
renderview. The 3Dconnexion Settings app provided with the driver
can be used to change the style of interaction from object-centered
to camera-centered (flying).

Works on Windows and Mac. A linux SDK is not available.
