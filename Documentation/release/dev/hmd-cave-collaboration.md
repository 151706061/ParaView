## Support Collaboration in CAVEs

The ParaView CAVEInteraction plugin now supports basic collaboration.
If you build ParaView with the CAVEInteraction plugin and collaboration
enabled, the plugin dock panel includes new UI allowing you to configure
your connection to the collaboration server.  It also allows you to
manage the mapping between events you have configured and your avatars
head and hands.

Using this new feature, you can collaborate with users in other CAVES,
as well as those using the XRInterface plugin.
