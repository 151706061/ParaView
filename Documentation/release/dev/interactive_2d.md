**Interactive 2D widgets and the equalizer filter**

ParaView now has the needed code base to support interactive widgets in context views such as the Line Chart View.
One of the first filter using this feature is the equalizer filter.

Here is an example of what you can do using the equalizer filter in ParaView

Source data:

After applying the filter:
![Equalizer filter and Interactive 2D](interactive_2d_after.png  "Equalizer filter")

This proposition was first discussed on discourse and implemented by the community, then fully integrated by Kitware.
See the [discourse thread](https://discourse.paraview.org/t/is-there-any-abilities-to-add-a-interactive-widgets-on-linechartview-same-as-3d-widgets-on-renderview/2273).
