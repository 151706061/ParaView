# New feature: Save OSPRay materials in the material editor

Add the capability to save the materials created in the material editor (enabled with PARAVIEW_ENABLE_RAYTRACING and VTK_ENABLE_OSPRAY) using the 'Save materials' button.
All materials are written in a new single json file (see https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/materials/blob/master/ospray_mats.json for an example).
