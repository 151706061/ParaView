## Save and Load PNG with embedded ParaView State as MetaData

ParaView now has an option to embed the ParaView state as metadata when saving a screenshot as `.png`.
ParaView can also load a state from a `.png` image that has embedded state as metadata.
If a png with embedded state is dragged and dropped on the ParaView application, a dialog will appear
asking you want to load the state or the image.
