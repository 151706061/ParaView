## Support selection mechanisms for the `Hyper Tree Grid`

You can now use the selection mechanisms tied to the "Render View" to select parts of `Hyper Tree Grid`s. Individual surface cell picking, "Frustum" cell picking, "Hover Over Cell" tooltips and selection through the "Find Data" panel are now active for `Hyper Tree Grid`s. Selections can also be extracted using the "Extract Selection" filter which should output a masked version of the original `Hyper Tree Grid`.
