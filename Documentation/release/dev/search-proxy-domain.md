## Properties search bar results includes widget proxies

The search bar in the Properties dock window now includes search terms
from proxies selected from a ProxyListDomain. This means panels for
interactive 3D widgets, like those used for Clip and Slice, have labels
from their XML definition included, so search terms like "normal" and
"origin" will include those widgets.
