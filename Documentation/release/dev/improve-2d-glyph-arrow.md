## Improve 2D Glyph arrow

New properties have been added to further customize the 2D Glyph simple arrow:
- **Tip Length**: the length of the tip can now be modified
- **Double Pointed**: if on, an arrow tip is added to the opposite side
- **Point Inwards**: the arrow tips point inwards rather than outwards
