## New PreservePropertyValues settings

ParaView already let you configure default properties values from the dedicated button in the properties panel. With the **PreservePropertyValues** settings, this can be done automatically after each modification! It concerns every filter, source, reader and extrator and will occur right after clicking on **Apply**.â€¯So the next time you create your favorite filter, it will come with your last configuration.
