## Save default values for individual property widgets

In the Properties panel, two icons at the top of each section let the user save the current values
shown in property widgets as the defaults for the next time this source/filter is created, or reset
all values to the application defaults. Now each property widget has a context menu, available by
right-clicking on the widget's label, to "Use as Default", or "Reset to Application Default" for
just that item. The context menu is not shown if the property can't take these actions.
