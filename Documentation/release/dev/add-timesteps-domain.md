# Add a timesteps domain

A new timesteps domain has been added to fill
a double vector property with input timesteps.

It can be used like this:

```
<TimeStepsDomain name = "timesteps">
  <RequiredProperties>
    <Property function = "Input" name = "Input" / >
  < / RequiredProperties>
< / TimeStepsDomain>
```
