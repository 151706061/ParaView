## New setting for enabling or not array magnitude computation

You may sometimes want to disable the computation of the magnitude of some data attributes
according to the number of components they have. For example the magnitude of 2D data fields
may not hold specific meaning for your use cases and disabling them can improve GUI readability
as well as performance.

It is now possible to control this behavior in the "Miscellaneous" section of ParaView
settings.
