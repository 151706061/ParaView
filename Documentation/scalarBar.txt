Scalar Bar

In ParaView, the scalar bar is used to display the range of values being displayed by color in the current data set.  The interface for controlling the parameters of the scalar bar is contained in the Display page.  The scalar bar interface is only added to the display page if the current data set has underlying data values.  (There is no need for a scalar bar if the data set only contains geometry.)

When a scalar bar is displayed in ParaView, the name associated with it is the name of the array containing the underlying data.  The scalar bar is also set up to display 5 labels specifying the value of the scalar bar at specific intervals.

In ParaView, the user can set the visibility, orientation, colormap, and range of the scalar bar.  The "Reset Range" button resets the color bar range to the range of the data values being used to color the data set.  The colormaps available inside ParaView are red to blue, blue to red, and grayscale.

For the red to blue colormap, the minimum value is displayed in red, and the maximum value is displayed in blue.  Exactly the reverse is true for the blue to red colormap.  Grayscale maps the minimum value to black and the maximum one to white.
