# This module contains an example customizable python interactor style
# for use in CAVEs. The SimplyFlyer class requires a tracker device
# with at least one button and one valuator. It allows you to fly in
# the direction you are pointing your controller, and to control your
# speed using the valuator. You can also return to the origin, or
# "reset navigation" using the button. There is a wide variety of
# devices out there, so to allow you to hold your particular device
# in the most ergonomic orientation relative to your hand, you can
# choose which column of the tracker matrix corresponds to your
# desired flight direction by setting the "flyDirectionColumn" class
# member.

    "create_interactor_style()" which constructs and returns an
