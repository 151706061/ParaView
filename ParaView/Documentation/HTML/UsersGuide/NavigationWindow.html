<h1>Using the Navigation Window</h1>

<img alt="Navigation Frame" src="Images/navigationFrame.jpg">
<p>
The navigation window is a graphical representation of the pipeline
structure used in ParaView.  Items are added to the pipeline as the user
loads data or performs filtering operations on the data.  New filtering
operations are performed on the current data set even if this data set is
somewhere in the middle of the pipeline.  If the data set is not at the end
of the pipeline, the new filtering operation will cause the pipeline to branch.
In the example shown, both elevation and extract edges filtering operations
were performed on the ShrinkPD1 data set.
</p>
<p>
The name of the currently active data set is drawn in black and is centered in
the navigation frame.  The names of the data sets directly before and directly
after this one in the pipeline are displayed in blue text.  These names of
these data sets are connected by arrows to the name of the current data set,
indicating the filtering pipeline structure.  Clicking on the data set names
displayed in blue will <b>1)</b> make that data set active and <b>2)</b>
bring up the user interface corresponding to that data set.
</p>

If
there are more data sets in the pipeline that are not currently represented
in the navigation frame, an elipsis (...) is drawn on the corresponding end
of the navigation frame.  </p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Only data sets at the end of the pipeline can be removed from the
pipeline.  This is done by clicking the "Delete" button on the Parameters
page associated with that data set.
