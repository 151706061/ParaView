<h1>Using the Probe Filter
    <img alt="Probe Button" src="Images/probeButton.jpg"></h1>

The vtkProbeFilter is used for sampling the data values of a data set at
specified point locations.  In ParaView, we supply two options for
specifying point locations: a single point at a time or at evenly spaced
points along a line.  When probing with a point, all the underlying point
data is displayed in the user interface.  When using a line, the data is
displayed in an xy-plot in the render window.  In the user interface, you
can change which data array is being displayed.

Regardless of whether you choose to probe with a point or a line, you need to
select the coordinates of points in your data set.  To select a point, you
can either type the coordinates into the user interface or select the point
interactively using the 3D cursor
<img alt="3D Cursor" src="Images/3DCursorButton.jpg">.  If it is not already
selected, click the 3D cursor button on the interactor toolbar to display the
3D cursor.

The 3D cursor consists of a bounding box of the current data set, a 3D axis,
and spheres at the intersection of the axis and the faces of the bounding box.
To select a point using the 3D cursor, move the mouse over one of these spheres
(which will cause the sphere to turn red).  Then click on the sphere and drag
it to select a new point.  If you wish to move a sphere on a face that is not
currently visible, select another of the interactors from the toolbar (most
likely the one for rotation) and change the view so that the desired face is
visible.  Then select the 3D cursor interactor again to continue choosing a
point.
<p>

If you choose to probe with a point, then you must select which point in
the data to display information about.

If you are probing with a line, you need to select the endpoints of the line
within the data set along which to collect information.  Choose an endpoint
from the "Select End Point" menu to select coordinates for, and then
choose the position of the endpoint.  If you are using a line, you can also
specify the number of subdivisions you wish to break the line into.  The
number of subdivisions determines the number of points used in probing.

Once you have set the values for the parameters displayed in the user
interface for probing, click the "Accept" button to see the results.
