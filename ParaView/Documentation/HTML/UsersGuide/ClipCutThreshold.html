<h1>Using Clip, Cut and Threshold Filters</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Clip, Cut and Threshold are three filters that are available on the filter
toolbar.

<p>

These three fitlers have similar functionality and will accept any data set
as input.  They will be demonstrated on a structured volume generated by
the vtkMandelbrotSource available in the VTK-Sources menu.

<p>

This source combines Mandelbrot set and Julia set functions to produce a
three-dimensional subspace sampling of the four dimensional fractal.  It is
a useful source for testing because the samples are computed internally,
and the complexity of the data scales with sample resolution.

For these examples we are using a very low resolution sampled volume of
dimensions 51x51x21.

<h2>Cutting</h2>

The current implementation of cutting samples the volume on points in a
plane.  The sample points are derived from the input data.  Any cell
edge/plane instersection becomes a point in the output.  The cut operation
is very similar to contouring, but using an implicit plane instead of point
scalars.  The output of the cut filter is always vtkPolyData.

<p>

There are three parameters that drive the cutting operation. The cut plane
is defined by a point on the plane, and a normal. The point defaults to the
center of the bounds of the input data set, and can be modified by the user
in the "Center" entry.  The input bounds are displayed so that the user can
choose meaningful values. The "Set Plane Center to Center of Bounds" button
will reset the center to the default value.
<p>
The normal of the cut plane can be set by the user in the "Normal" entry.
The normal has to be a non zero vector, but does not have to be normalized.
However, the magnitude of this vector does effect the interpretation of the
"Offset".  Four default values can be used to set the normal of the cut
plane.  The "X Normal", "Y Normal" and "Z Normal" buttons set the normal to
produce YZ, XZ and YZ planes respectively.  The "Use Camera Normal" uses
the view-plane normal to set the cut-plane normal.  The view-plane normal
points into the screen, and produces a cut plane that is parallel to the
view screen.
<p>
The "Offset" of the plane allows the user to move the plane away from the
center in the direction of the cut plane normal.  The same effect can be
achieved by moving the cut-plane center point, but changing the offset can
be more convienient.
<p>
In the future, we may extent the clip options to generate surfaces at
multiple offsets, or use other implicit functions like a sphere.  We may
also extend the interface to interactively manipulate the cut plane.
<p>

<h2>Clipping</h2>

The clip filter is very similar to the cut filter, but all of the data on
one side of the plane is extracted. Data in the direction of the normal is
kept.  Individual cells are divided as necessary to give a clean cut
surface.  The output of the clip fitlers is always vtkUnstructuredGrid.
Unlike the clip filter which changes volumes to surfaces and surfaces to
points, the clip filter does not change the dimensionality of its input.

<p>

<p>

The clip filter currently has an identical interface to the cut filters.
The center, normal and offset of the plane can all be manipulated.

In the future we plan to extend the clip fitlers user interface to clip
with scalars contained in the data as well as additional implicit functions
other than a plane.

<h2>Thresholding</h2>

The threshold filter is somewhat similar to the clip filters, but it uses
data set values to remove cells instead of an implcit function.  Also the
threshold fitlers does not divide individual cells.  A cell either gets put
in the output or is completely removed.  This can be confusing when a data
set has complex cell types.  Triangle strips, line strips, and poly
verticies all contain multiple faces in one cell.  The threshold filter
will not differentiate between these internal sub cells, so more data could
be removed than expected.

<p>

<p>

The threshold filters user interface allows the user to select which field
array to use for thresholding.  Only single components arrays can be
selected.  The user can not threshold by a vector array.  The "Attribute
Mode" selection allows the user to choose between cell centered data arrays
and points centered data arrays.
<p>

If "Point Data" is used, then the "All Scalars" toggle becomes significant.
When this toggle is on, all of a cells verticies must be within the
threshold criteria for the cell to be put in the output.  When this toggle
is off, then only a single cell vertex has to meet the critera for the cell
to be kept.
<p>

The upper and lower threshold sliders define the threshold critera.  The
lower threshold defaults to the minimum array value, and the upper
threshold defaults to the maximum array value.  With the default, no cells
would be removed.
