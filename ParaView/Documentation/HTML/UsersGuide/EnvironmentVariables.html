<h1>Environment Variables</h1>

ParaView looks for a few environment variables that can be used to modifiy its behavior.

<h2>PV_INTERFACE_PATH</h2>

<p>
This variable is used for adding custon VTK filters to ParaView's user interface.
It should point to the directory which contains the XML descriptions of the
additional filters or sources.
</p>

<h2>PV_OFFSCREEN</h2>

<p>
This environment variable is important only when running with multiple processes.  
It determines whether off screen rendering will be used for the satellite processes.
The default behavior is for each node to map a window and use hardware rendering.
When the assigned processors do not have access to a display, this environment
variable should be set to "True" (any value will do).  When this varible is set,
ParaView only maps the render window of the first process.  Software render
will be used for the other processes.  Of course, using software rendering will 
affect ParaView's rendering performance.
</p>

<p>
It is important to note that currently, you must link against Mesa's OpenGL 
libraries to get offscreen rendering on unix systems.
</p>

<h2>PV_SEPARATE_RENDER_WINDOW</h2>

<p>
Setting this environmant varible to "True" (or any value) will cause ParaView to 
create a render window separate from its main interface window.
</p>

<h2>PV_DISABLE_COMPOSITE_INTERRUPTS</h2>

<p>
Since still renders can take a substantial amount of time, ParaView has the ability
to interrupt a long render when another event comes along.  Although this is relativly
straight forward when rendering with a single processes, interrupting multiple
processes during rendering and compositing is tricky.  The implementation uses
asynchronous send and receives.  Setting this environment variable will
disable the interrupt feature.  It is primarily a debugging tool.
</p>

<h2>PV_USE_TRANSMIT</h2>

<p>
Many sources and readers in VTK cannot break up their output into pieces.
In order to parallize subsequent operations, ParaView breaks up the data after
it has been generated/loaded.  Unfortunately, this can be inefficient.  ParaView's
default behavior is to have each process load the entire data set, and then throw
away the portions they do not need.  This means every process will be accessing
the same file at the same time.
</p>

<p>
Setting this envirnment variable to "True" causes ParaView to use a more efficient
strategry.  The first process reads the entire data set, and then transmits
pieces of the data set to the satellite processes.  Unfortunately, there are some
VTK pipeline issues that have not been completely resolved with this strategy.
All processes must execute or a deadlock will occur.  Although most of the time
ParaView can use this strategy without incident, there is a small possiblilty
that ParaView might hang.  I can currently only get ParaView to hang when using 
a vtkCleanPolyDataFilter with result invariance on.  Until this issue is resolved,
this feature is turned off by default.
</p>

<h2>PV_DEBUG_HALF</h2>

<p>
This envirnment variable fools ParaView into thinking it has twice as many processors
than it actually has.  When it is set to "True", only half of any data set is processed
and rendered.  It is primarly used for debugging purposes.
