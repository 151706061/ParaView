<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
ParaView is a turnkey application built on top of VTK.  
It was designed to handle large data set by distributing the 
data across multiple computers, but can also be used as a stand-alone 
single-process application.
</p>

<p>
ParaView's user interface and operations are closely tied to the 
pipeline model in VTK.  Loading data creates a VTK reader object, 
and processing the data (i.e. creating a contour) adds a VTK filter 
to the pipeline.  Although creating a single pipeline is easy,  
ParaView allows the user to build complex branching pipelines,
which can get confusing.
</p>

<p>
ParaView has the concept of a current data set, which is ussually 
the last data loaded, or the result of the last filtering operation.
The current data set is used as the input to any new filter created.
The filters listed in the VTK-Filter menu are screened so that only 
filters that will accept the current data as input are shown. 
The current data can be changed by using the "Select" menu or 
by using the navigation window to move through the pipeline. 
</p>

<p>
This navigation feature allows you change parameters of any filter, 
even if it is in the middle of the pipeline.  The pipeline 
automactically updates to reflect changes made to filter parameters.
