<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2> Overview </h2>

<p>
ParaView is a turnkey application built on top of VTK.  
ParaView was designed to handle large data sets by distributing the 
data across multiple computers, but can also be used as a stand-alone 
single-process application.
</p>

<p>
ParaView's user interface and operations are closely tied to the 
pipeline model in VTK.  Loading data creates a VTK reader object, 
and processing data (i.e. creating a contour) adds a VTK filter 
to the pipeline.  Creating a single non-branching pipeline using ParaView 
is trivial. Each new filter adds to the end of the pipeline. 
ParaView also allows advanced users to construct, navigate and modify 
complex branching pipelines.
</p>

<p>
ParaView has the concept of a current data set, which is usually 
the last data loaded, or the result of the last filtering operation.
The current data set is used as the input to any new filter created.
The filters listed in the VTK-Filter menu are screened so that only 
filters that will accept the current data as input are shown. 
The current data can be changed by using the "Select" menu or 
by using the navigation window to move through the pipeline. 
</p>

<p>
The navigation feature allows you change parameters of any filter, 
even if it is in the middle of the pipeline.  The whole pipeline 
automatically updates to reflect changes made to filter parameters.
</p>

<h2> VTK </h2>
Although knowledge of VTK should not be a prerequisite for using ParaView,
there are several VTK resources available that may be useful for
understanding ParaView.  The freely available 
<a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/doc/nightly/html/">
VTK manual pages 
</a>
are automatically generated from the comments in the VTK source.  
Although several commonly used filters are directly
accessible from ParaView's toolbars and are self explanatory, many of VTK's
more obscure filters have to be accessed from ParaView's VTK-Source and VTK-Filters menus.
VTK's manual pages can help you determine the function of the objects in these menus. 
As ParaView develops further, common operations 
will be more closely integrated in ParaView, so accessing the supplemental
operations in the VTK-Source/VTK-Filter menus should become less common.
</p>

<p>
The 
<a href="http://www.kitware.com/products/vtkguide.html">
VTK User Guide 
</a>
is also available if you would like a deeper 
understanding of VTK and its pipeline model.
</p>



<h2> Parallel Execution </h2>

ParaView's parallel execution model is simple.  When running on 
more than one process, data sets are automatically divided up 
between processes.  An identical pipeline is create in each process
to filter and render its assigned data-set piece. The separate images
from the individual processes are composited and displayed in the applications user interface
running on the first process.
