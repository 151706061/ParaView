<h1>Generating Contours (Isosurfaces)
    <img alt="Contour Button" src="Images/contourButton.jpg"></h1>

The contour filter is used to generate isosurfaces and isolines from scalar
values in a data set.  If the VTK library a particular version of ParaView
is using includes the patented classes, contouring is done with the
vtkKitwareContourFilter.  Otherwise vtkContourFilter is used.  Regardless,
the interface to contouring within ParaView is the same.
<p>
First the user must select which point data array to use to generate contours.
When the array is selected, the data range of that array is displayed in the
user interface.  Then any number of contour values can be entered.  The contour
values desired should be entered in the "New Value" entry box.  The value
can be entered into the list of contour values either by pressing the
"Enter" key or by clicking the "Add Value" button.  In order to remove a
value from the list, click on the value and then click the "Delete Value"
button.
<p>
The user must also decide whether to have normals, gradients, and scalars
computed for the isosurfaces or isolines generated by the contour filter.
(<b>Note:</b> Selecting "Compute Normals" or "Compute Gradients" will have no
effect if the vtkContourFilter -- as opposed to the vtkKitwareContourFilter --
is used.)
Computation of normals is fairly expensive (in terms of both time and
storage) as is computation of gradients.  Especially if further filtering
is to be done on the isosurfaces or isolines, it may be wise to turn off
computation of gradients and normals.  If scalars are computed, then for
each point in a particular isocontour, the corresponding contour value will
be stored.  Typically scalars are computed when contours are generated.
