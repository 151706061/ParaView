<h1>View Manipulation and Behaviour</h1>

There are several different ways to manipulate the view of you data in
ParaView.  In the upper left corner of the application is the view toolbar.
The first button on this toolbar resets the view to all the visible data
sets.
<center>
<img alt="Reset View Button" src="Images/ResetViewButton.jpg">
</center>

If you would like to reset the view to show a single data set, you should
press the "Set View To Data" button on the data's display page.

<p>
<center>
<img alt="Set View to Data" src="Images/SetViewToData.jpg">
</center>
<p>

The remaining buttons activate different interactors states.  The current
interactor state is indicated by the highlighted button, and special
cursors when the mouse is over the render window.

<p>
<center>
<img alt="Fly Button" src="Images/FlyButton.jpg">
</center>
<p>

The "Fly" interactor causes the view to move toward where the cursor is
pointing.  When the cursor is in the middle of the view, the interactor
zooms.  When the cursor is near the edge of the view, the fly interactor
pans the view.  This interactor is most useful when trying to position the
view internal to several elements.  The left mouse button flys forward, and
the right mouse button flys backward.  None of the interactors use the
middle mouse button.

<p>
<center>
<img alt="Rotate Button" src="Images/RotateButton.jpg">
</center>
<p>

The "Rotate" interactor is the default interactor.  Its behavior also
depends on where the cursor is position over the view.  The left mouse
button rotates around the center of rotation.  The center of rotation is
indicated by the cross hairs in the view.  You can change the center of
rotation using the center of rotation toolbar.  Reset puts the center of
rotation in the current view.  You can also select the center of rotation
by selecting the pick-center-of-rotation icon.  There is also an entry
available to manually select the center of roation point.

There are two options for rotation that depend on when you first click in
the view.  When you mouse near the center of rotation, you get the standard
rotation around the view's X and Y axes.  When you start rotation by
clicking far from the center of rotation, the you get a roll behavior which
is rotation around the views Z axis.

For convenience, in the rotation interactor state, the right mouse button
behaves like the translation interactor.

<p>
<center>
<img alt="Translate Button" src="Images/TranslateButton.jpg">
</center>
<p>

The translate interactor allows you to pan the view.  Once again, its
behavior depends on where you first click on the view.  When you click in
upper or lower thirds of the view, you get a zooming behavor which moves
the view along it's Z axis.  Clicking in the middle third of the view gives
a paning interaction which translates the view along its X and Y axes.


<h1> Levels of Detail </h1>

<p>
ParaView has two mode for rendering: still and interactive.  
The interactive mode is set when the user is interactively
manipulating the view.  The still mode is used for the final render
after interaction has stopped.
</p>

<p>
Level of details (LOD) may be used to increase the frame rate for interactive renders.
ParaView uses two LOD techniques.  A decimated model can replace the full resolution
model to keep the polygon count low.  Also, when ParaView is rendering in parallel,
pixel replication is used to reduce the cost of compositing.  The application of
these two techniques can be controlled fro the user interface.  In the upper right 
toolbar contains a reduction check box and a frame rate slider.
</p>

<p>
<center>
<img alt="Frame Rate Slider" src="Images/FrameRateSlider.jpg">
</center>
<p>

<p>
Pixel replication is only used when the reduction box is checked.  
The frame rate slider determines the amount of time that is allocated
for each interactive render.  When the slider is all the way to the left,
an unlimited amount of time is allocated, so no LOD techniques are used.
When the slider is moved to the right, less time is allocated and ParaView
will start using decimate models and rendering lower resolution images.
