Calculator

	The vtkArrayCalculator is used for performing mathematical operations on arrays of scalar or vector data in a data set.  To use this filter from within ParaView, click on the button in the toolbar with a calculator icon.  Select whether to operate on point-centered data or cell-centered data (i.e., the attribute mode).  Choose a name for the array that will contain the results of the mathematical operation.  (By default, the name of the new array is set to "resultArray".)  The two buttons near the bottom of the calculator interface labeled "scalars" and "vectors" are menu buttons that allow you to choose which arrays to operate on.  Click the appropriate buttons and array names to set up the mathematical expression you wish to evaluate.  If you make a mistake, you can click the "Clear" button.  When you have entered the expression to evaluate, click the "Accept" button for the evaluation to take place.  The results will be stored in a new array in the data set with the array name specified.
