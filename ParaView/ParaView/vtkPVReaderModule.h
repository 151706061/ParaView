// .NAME vtkPVReaderModule - Module representing a reader
// .SECTION Description
// The class vtkPVReaderModule is used to represent a reader (or a pipeline
// which contains a reader). A prototype for each file type is created at
// startup by parsing the (XML) configuration file. Later, when the user
// tries to open a file, the prototypes are consulted. The first prototype
// which respond positively to CanReadFile() is asked to read the file and
// create a new instance of a vtkPVReaderModule (or any subclass) to be
// added to the list of existing sources.
//
// .SECTION See also
// vtkPVAdvancedReaderModule vtkPVEnSightReaderModule

  // Description:
  // Set up the UI for this source. The only default element created is a
  // file entry. Of course, more can be added in the configuration file.
  virtual void CreateProperties();

  // Description:
  // Returns true (1) if the current reader can read the specified file,
  // false (0) otherwise. In the default implementation, this is done by
  // comparing the extension of the file to a list of extensions specified
  // by the configuration (XML) file -see AddExtension-.
  virtual int CanReadFile(const char* fname);

  // Description:
  // Tries to read a given file. Return VTK_OK on success, VTK_ERROR
  // on failure. A new instance of a reader module (which contains the 
  // actual VTK reader to be used) is returned. This should be called
  // only on a prototype. (This method replaces ClonePrototype defined
  // in superclass).
  virtual int ReadFile(const char* fname, vtkPVReaderModule*& newModule);

  // Description:
  // Add extension recognized by the reader. This is displayed in the
  // selection dialog and used in the default implementation of
  // CanReadFile().

  // Description:
  // Get the number of registered file extensions.

  // Description:
  // Get the ith file extension.
  const char* GetExtension(vtkIdType i);

  // Description:
  // This tells vtkPVWindow whether it should call Accept() on the module
  // returned by ReadFile. In the default implementation, the ReadFile()
  // creates a clone and sets up all the filename (which is the only user
  // modifiable option). Since the user does not have to make any
  // selections before the file is loaded, vtkPVWindow calls Accept instead
  // of the user. This behaviour is changed in vtkPVAdvancedReaderModule
  // which first calls UpdateInformation() on the VTK reader, obtains some
  // preliminary information from the file and then prompts the user for
  // some stuff. In this situation, vtkPVWindow does not call Accept. This
  // is mainly used to avoid reading the whole file before asking the user
  // the initial configuration (for example, the user might want to load
  // only a subset of available attriutes)

  // create a new instance of the same type as the current object using
  // NewInstance() and then call ClonePrototype() on all widgets and add
  // these clones to it's widget list. The return value is VTK_OK is the
  // cloning was successful.
