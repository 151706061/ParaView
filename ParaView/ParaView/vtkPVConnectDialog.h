// .NAME vtkPVConnectDialog
// .SECTION Description
// A class to encapaulate all of the process initialization,
// distributed data model and duplication  of the pipeline.
// Filters and compositers will still need a controller, 
// but every thing else should be handled here.  This class 
// sets up the default MPI processes with the user interface
// running on process 0.  I plan to make an alternative module
// for client server mode, where the client running the UI 
// is not in the MPI group but links to the MPI group through 
// a socket connection.
