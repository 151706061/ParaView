  <h2><a name="wininst">Installing binaries on Windows</a></h2>
  Run PVSetup.exe and follow instructions.<p>
  <h2><a name="compcomp">Compiling ParaView Complete</a></h2>
  This distribution of ParaView Complete contains ParaView, VTK and Tcl/Tk
  8.2.3. You
  do not have to download VTK or Tcl/Tk separately to compile. However, if you
  want to use your own VTK, you should not use this distribution. Instead, use
  the ParaView distribution which does not contain VTK.
  <p>
  <b>Run CMake and Compile</b><br>
  Once CMake is installed, you are ready to build VTK and ParaView. We highly
  recommend reading the CMake documentation if you are not familiar with CMake:
  <a href = "http://public.kitware.com/CMake/HTML/Documentation.html">http://public.kitware.com/CMake/HTML/Documentation.html</a>.
  (You can skip the Developer's Guide if you are not going to work with
  CMakeLists files.)
  In summary, ParaView Complete build consists of:<ol>
    <li> Running one of the CMake user interfaces </li>
    <li> Changing configuration options  </li>
    <li> Compiling (make on Unix, Visual Studio on Windows)</li>
  </ol>

  On Windows, you should use the CMakeSetup.exe application to setup
  the VTK and ParaView build. On Unix/Linux, you should use the CMake wizard
  (cmake -i) or the terminal interface (ccmake). See the CMake documentation
  for details.
  <p>
  ParaView Complete is designed such that all the default build options
  selected by CMake for VTK and ParaView are appropriate for building ParaView.
  However you might have to tell CMake the location of some include files and
  libraries (for example MPI libraries if you enabled MPI support).

  <h3><a name="compcompun">Unix Installation</a></h3><p>
  The following instructions only apply to UNIX systems.  

  First we will give you the quick and dirty way to build ParaView Complete:
  <p>
  <ol>
    <li>untar the ParaView Complete distribution
    <li> cd ParaViewComplete
    <li> cmake -i (run cmake in wizard mode, where you have to answer questions about the build)<p>
  or<p>
        ccmake (run the terminal based interface to cmake where you interactively change build options)
    <li> if necessary change build options
    <li> make
  </ol>

  It is a very good idea to tell cmake what C and C++ compilers
  you will be using. This can avoid many build problems.
  On most systems you can pass this information to configure in the 
  following way:
  <pre>
  env CXX=/your/C++/compiler CC=/your/c/compiler cmake
  </pre>
  otherwise you must set CXX and CC in your environment and then
  run ccmake (or cmake -i).<p>

  If you are planning to build ParaView for multiple architectures then you can
  either make a copy of the entire ParaView tree for each architecture and then
  follow the instructions above. Or you can have one copy of
  the ParaView tree and compile it in a different manner (out-of-source). Instead of
  running cmake from the ParaViewComplete directory, create a new directory where
  you have some free disk space (not in the ParaViewComplete tree), a possible name
  would be paraview-solaris. cd into this directory and then run cmake similar to the
  following example:
<pre>
ls /home/joe_user
ParaViewComplete paraview-solaris paraview-sgi

cd paraview-solaris
ccmake /home/joe_user/ParaViewComplete
or
cmake -i /home/joe_user/ParaViewComplete
</pre>
This will create makefiles in the paraview-solaris directory.  Then you can run
make in paraview-solaris to compile ParaView Complete.  Repeat this process for
each architecture you wish to build.<p>

<h3><a name="compcompwin">Windows Installation</a></h3><p>
The Windows build process uses the CMake GUI CMakeSetup. Then you use the 
compiler make utility to compile as follows.
<ol>
  <li> Install ParaView Complete distribution by unzipping into the appropriate
      directory.
      
  <li> Execute CMakeSetup. This will pop-up a little
      GUI that allows you to tailor the build. It then starts
      building .dsw and .dsp files for Microsoft, or makefiles for Borland.
      You'll have to tell CMakeSetup where you've placed your ParaViewComplete
      source code, and where to build the object code and dll's (we'll call it
      "paraviewbin").
      
  <li> When CMakeSetup completes, start up msdev and load ParaViewComplete.dsw.
      Select ALL_BUILD project, and build it.
</ol>
We recommend a 300MByte minimum swap size or you might have trouble
during the link phase.<p>

<h2><a name="compexis">Compiling ParaView with Existing VTK</a></h2>
<b>Run CMake and Compile</b><br>
Once CMake and Tcl/Tk 8.2.3 are installed, you are ready to build VTK and
ParaView. We highly recommend reading the CMake documentation if you are not
familiar with CMake: <a href = "http://public.kitware.com/CMake/HTML/Documentation.html">http://public.kitware.com/CMake/HTML/Documentation.html</a>.
(You can skip the Developer's Guide if you are not going to work with
CMakeLists files.)
<p>
Detailed instructions  for configuring and compiling VTK can be found in
VTK/README.html. In summary, the VTK (and ParaView) build consists
of:
<ol>
<li> Running one of the CMake user interfaces </li>
<li> Changing configuration options  </li>
<li> Compiling (make on Unix, Visual Studio on Windows)</li>
</ol>

On Windows, you should use the CMakeSetup.exe application to setup
the VTK and ParaView build. On Unix/Linux, you should use the CMake wizard
(cmake -i) or the terminal interface (ccmake). See the CMake documentation
and VTK/README.html for details.
<p>
The following build options are the most important ones when building
VTK for ParaView. These are taken from real VTK configurations (from
both a Linux, gcc and a Windows, Visual C++ build, the values found
by CMake are shown inside square brackets). A brief description of 
each entry is given here to help users configure and build VTK with the 
right settings. When a value in the following list is optional, it is 
cleared described as such.  Otherwise, the entry must be set to a proper 
value. Note that some entries are marked (Unix/Linux only) or (Windows only) 
and are only relevant to the given operating system(s). Usually, CMake 
will automatically set all of the other build options to appropriate values. 
However, if a package which is needed by VTK is in an unusual place or if 
it encounters something unexpected, CMake might not be able to set 
an option/setting correctly and  you might get errors when compiling VTK. 
If you are not sure about what the  problem might be, you can contact 
the <a href="MailingList.html">
ParaView mailing list</a>.
<p>
<pre>
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS [OFF]
</pre>

If you are going to run ParaView in a distributed environment with
MPI, we recommend keeping BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF. This way, your ParaView
executable will not depend on many VTK and ParaView shared libraries
and you will have to distribute fewer shared libraries over the nodes
of your distributed environment. Other shared libraries (for example, tcl 
and tk libraries are usually shared) which ParaView is linked against will
have to exist (and in the path) on all nodes so that ParaView can find them
when running.

<pre>

(Unix/Linux only)
OPENGL_INCLUDE_PATH [/usr/include]

OPENGL_LIBRARY [/usr/lib/libGL.so]
</pre>

VTK requires OpenGL. On Windows, this library is almost always found
automatically by CMake. On Unix/Linux, you might need to set these values
if CMake does not find them when first run. Mesa include files and library
can be used instead of OpenGL ones without having to set any other options.

<pre>

TCL_INCLUDE_PATH [/usr/local/include]

TCL_LIBRARY [/usr/local/lib/libtcl8.2.so]

TK_INCLUDE_PATH [/usr/local/include]

TK_LIBRARY [/usr/local/lib/libtk8.2.so]

VTK_WRAP_TCL [ON]
</pre>

ParaView requires that VTK is built with Tcl/Tk bindings (VTK_WRAP_TCL
has to be on). Furthermore, it requires that Tcl/Tk 8.2.3 is used. Any 
other version of Tcl/Tk will not work. The cache values for the Tcl/Tk 
include paths and libraries have to be set appropriately. On Windows, we 
recommend that you install Tcl/Tk 8.2.3 binaries using the default path 
(C:/Program Files/Tcl/lib). In this case, CMake will automatically find
all the necessary paths. 

<pre>

VTK_USE_HYBRID [ON]

VTK_USE_PARALLEL [ON]

VTK_USE_RENDERING [ON]
</pre>

These modules are required by ParaView and should be turned on.
<p>
<pre>
VTK_USE_PATENTED [ON]
</pre>

The patented module is optional. Patented classes may require a license
for commercial use. Check the individual header files for patent information.

<pre>

VTK_USE_MPI [OFF]

MPI_INCLUDE_PATH [/usr/local/mpi/include]

MPI_LIBRARY [/usr/local/mpi/lib/libmpich.a]
</pre>

MPI is supported by VTK and ParaView but is optional. If this option is on,
you will have to specify the MPI include path and the MPI library.

Once VTK is built, compiling ParaView is simple. Run CMake as described
before for VTK but using the ParaView source and binary directories and
set the following value:

<pre>

VTK_BINARY_PATH [NOTFOUND]
</pre>

This entry should point to the VTK binary (build directory). This is where
VTK's CMakeCache.txt and vtkConfigure.h are. Once this entry is set, CMake
will read VTK's cache file for all the necessary information. You do not
have to set any other options.

Next build ParaView like you built VTK.
