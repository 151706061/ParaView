  <h2><a name="wininst">Installing binaries on Windows</a></h2>
  Run PVSetup.exe and follow instructions.<p>

  Uncompress the appropriate distribution (gunzip for .gz, uncompress for .Z),
  change the current directory to where you want the files to be extracted and
  extract (tar xf). This will extract the binaries into the bin/
  directory and support files into the share/paraview-1.0/ directory. We 
  recommend installing in /usr/local or /opt.
  <p>

  <h2><a name="compcomp">Compiling ParaView</a></h2>
  ParaView uses the <a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> 
  cross-platform build system. To compile ParaView, you will have to
  install CMake. Binary and source distributions of CMake can be
  found <a href="http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html">here</a>.
  If it exists for you platform, we highly recommend using a binary
  distribution. CMake 1.6.7 or newer is required.<p>
  The complete distribution of ParaView contains VTK and Tcl/Tk
  8.3.2. You do not have to download VTK or Tcl/Tk separately to compile.
  <p>
  <b>Run CMake and Compile</b><br>
  Once CMake is installed, you are ready to build ParaView. We highly
  recommend reading the CMake documentation if you are not familiar with CMake:
  <a href = "http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Documentation.html">http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Documentation.html</a>.
  (You can skip the Developer's Guide.)
  In summary, ParaView Complete build consists of:<ol>
    <li> Running one of the CMake user interfaces </li>
    <li> Changing configuration options  </li>
    <li> Compiling (make on Unix, Visual Studio on Windows)</li>
  </ol>

  On Windows, you should use the CMakeSetup.exe application to setup
  the VTK and ParaView build. On Unix/Linux, you should use the CMake wizard
  (cmake -i) or the terminal interface (ccmake). See the CMake documentation
  for details.
  <p>
  ParaView distribution is designed such that all the default build options
  selected by CMake for VTK and ParaView are appropriate for building ParaView.
  However you might have to tell CMake the location of some include files and
  libraries (for example MPI libraries if you enabled MPI support).

  <h3><a name="compcompun">Unix/Linux</a></h3><p>
  The following instructions only apply to Unix/Linux systems.  

  First we will give you the quick and dirty way to build ParaView:
  <p>
  <ol>
    <li> untar the ParaViewComplete distribution
    <li> cd ParaViewComplete06
    <li> cmake -i (run cmake in wizard mode, where you have to answer questions about the build)<p>
  or<p>
        ccmake (run the terminal based interface to cmake where you interactively change build options)
    <li> if necessary change build options
    <li> make
  </ol>

  It is a very good idea to tell cmake what C and C++ compilers
  you will be using. This can prevent many build problems.
  On most systems you can pass this information to CMake in the 
  following way:
  <pre>
  env CXX=/your/C++/compiler CC=/your/c/compiler cmake
  </pre>
  otherwise you must set CXX and CC in your environment and then
  run ccmake (or cmake -i).<p>

  If you are planning to build ParaView for multiple architectures then you can
  either make a copy of the entire ParaView tree for each architecture and then
  follow the instructions above. Or you can have one copy of the ParaView 
  tree and compile it in a different manner (out-of-source). Instead of
  running cmake from the ParaViewComplete06 directory, create a new directory 
  where you have some free disk space (not in the ParaViewComplete tree), 
  a possible name would be paraview06-solaris. cd into this directory and 
  then run cmake similar to the following example:
<pre>
ls /home/joe_user
ParaViewComplete06 paraview06-solaris paraview06-sgi

cd paraview06-solaris
ccmake /home/joe_user/ParaViewComplete06
or
cmake -i /home/joe_user/ParaViewComplete06
</pre>
This will create makefiles in the paraview06-solaris directory.  Then you can 
run make in paraview06-solaris to compile ParaView.  Repeat this 
process for each architecture you wish to build. Please note that on
some platforms, it might be necessary to use the GNU Make to compile 
out-of-source.
This is due to the fact that the Tcl/Tk build process uses some
features not available on all make distributions.<p>

<h3><a name="compcompwin">Windows Installation</a></h3><p>
The Windows build process uses the CMake GUI, CMakeSetup. After
running CMake, you use the compiler make utility to compile as follows.
<ol>
  <li> Install ParaView distribution by unzipping into the appropriate
      directory.
      
  <li> Execute CMakeSetup. This will pop-up a little
      GUI that allows you to tailor the build. It then starts
      building .dsw and .dsp files (Visual Studio 6), solution files 
      (Visual Studio .NET ) or makefiles (nmake, Visual Studio 6 and .NET).
      You'll have to tell CMakeSetup where you've placed your ParaView
      source code, and where to build the object code and dll's (we'll call it
      "paraviewbin").
      
  <li> When CMakeSetup completes, start up Visual Studio and load 
  ParaViewComplete.dsw or ParaViewComplete.sln. Select the ALL_BUILD project, 
  and build it.
</ol>
We recommend a 300MByte minimum swap size or you might have trouble
during the link phase.<p>
