    <b><font size=3>Install </font></b> and build ParaView differently depending on the
    operating system. Either way, you must build and/or install 
    <a href="http://public.kitware.com/CMake">CMake</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.visualizationtoolkit.org/">VTK</a>, and 
    <a href="ftp://tcl.activestate.com/pub/tcl/tcl8_2/">Tcl/Tk 8.2.3</a> 
    prior to compiling and installing ParaView. Please note that ParaView
    <em>requires</em> Tcl/Tk 8.2.3. It will not work with any other version.
    <p>
    <b><font size=3>Run CMake and Compile</font></b><br>
    Once this software is installed, you are ready to build ParaView.
    To compile VTK and ParaView, you will need CMake. Downloading and installation
    instructions for CMake can be found at http://public.kitware.com/CMake
    We highly recommend reading the CMake documentation if you are not familiar
    with CMake: http://public.kitware.com/CMake/HTML/Documentation.html
    (you can skip the Developer's Guide if you are not going to work with
    CMakeLists files).
    <p>
    Once CMake is installed, you are ready to compile VTK. Detailed instructions 
    for configuring and compiling VTK can be found in VTK/README.html. In summary,
    configuring the VTK (and ParaView) build consists of:
    <ol>
    <li> Initial CMake pass </li>
    <li> Changing configuration options (cache values) </li>
    <li> Next CMake pass: depending on the changes you made, new configuration
         (cache) values might appear  </li>
    <li> If necessary, go to step (2) and repeat until all the required
         options are set.</li>
    </ol>

    On Windows, step (1) is starting  CMakeSetup.exe and setting the source
    directory (where the source code for VTK is) and the directory where
    the libraries, object files and binaries will be (can be same as the source
    directory if you want to build "in-place") and pressing "Configure".
    Step (2) requires changing values using the user interface. Step (3)
    requires pressing "Configure". When done, you should click "OK".
    <p>
    On Unix/Linux, step (1) requires running cmake for the first time, for
    example:
<pre>
# Create the build directory (the name is arbitrary). This is where 
# the executables, libraries and object files will be. If building 
# "in-place", you can skip this step and use the source directory as 
# also the build directory.
% mkdir vtk-build
# Run cmake
% cmake /path/to/vtk/source/ # for example % cmake ../VTK
</pre>
    Step (2) requires editing the cache file (CMakeCache.txt in the build
    directory) with a text editor and finally, step (3) requires running
    cmake again.
    <p>
    Once the configuration is completed, you can build VTK. On Linux/Unix,
    run make in the build directory (on some platforms, you might need to use
    gmake if you are building "out-of-place" since some versions of make do 
    not support out-of-place builds). On Windows, load the project file 
    (VTK.dsw in  the build directory is using Visual C++) and build the 
    ALL_BUILD target.
    <p>
    The following cache entries are the most important ones when building
    VTK for ParaView. These are taken from real CMakeCache.txt files (from
    both a Linux, gcc and a Windows, Visual C++ build). A brief description of 
    each entry is given here to help users configure and build VTK with the 
    right settings. When a value in the following list is optional, it is 
    cleared described as such.  Otherwise, the entry must be set to a proper 
    value. Note that some entries are marked (Unix/Linux only) or (Windows only) 
    and are only relevant to the given operating system(s). Usually, CMake 
    will automatically set all of the other cache entries to appropriate values. 
    However, if a package which is needed by VTK is in an unusual place or if 
    it encounters something unexpected, CMake might not be able to find set 
    a cache entry correctly and  you might get errors when compiling VTK. 
    If you are not sure about what the  problem might be, you can contact 
    the <a href="http://public.kitware.com/ParaView/HTML/MailingList.html">ParaView 
    mailing list</a>.

<pre>
//Build VTK with shared libraries.
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF
</pre>

    If you are going to run ParaView in a distributed environment with
    MPI, we recommend keeping BUILD_SHARED_LIBS off. This way, your ParaView
    executable will not depend on many VTK and ParaView shared libraries
    and you will have to distribute fewer shared libraries over the nodes
    of your distributed environment. Other shared libraries (for example, tcl 
    and tk libraries are usually shared) which ParaView is linked against will
    have to exist (and in the path) on all nodes so that ParaView can find them
    when running.

<pre>
//(Unix/Linux only)
//What is the path where the file GL/gl.h can be found
OPENGL_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/include

//Where can the GL library be found
OPENGL_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/libGL.so
</pre>

    VTK requires OpenGL. On Windows, this library is almost always found
    automatically by CMake. On Unix/Linux, you might need to set these values
    if CMake does not find them when first run. Mesa include files and library
    can be used instead of OpenGL ones without having to set any other cache
    values.

<pre>
//What is the path where the file tcl.h can be found
TCL_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/local/include

//Where can one of the tcl, tcl84, tcl8.4, tcl83, tcl8.3, tcl82,
// tcl8.2, tcl80 or tcl8.0 libraries be found
TCL_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/local/lib/libtcl8.2.so

//What is the path where the file tk.h can be found
TK_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/local/include

//Where can one of the tk, tk84, tk8.4, tk83, tk8.3, tk82, tk8.2,
// tk80 or tk8.0 libraries be found
TK_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/local/lib/libtk8.2.so

//(Windows only)
//What is the path where the file X11/Xlib.h can be found
TK_XLIB_PATH:PATH=NOTFOUND

//wrap classes into the TCL intepreted language
VTK_WRAP_TCL:BOOL=ON
</pre>

    ParaView requires that VTK is built with Tcl/Tk bindings (VTK_WRAP_TCL
    has to be on). Furthermore, it requires that Tcl/Tk 8.2.3 is used. Any 
    other version of Tcl/Tk will not work. The cache values for the Tcl/Tk 
    include paths and libraries have to be set appropriately. On Windows, we 
    recommend that you install Tcl/Tk 8.2.3 binaries using the default path 
    (C:/Program Files/Tcl/lib). In this case, CMake will automatically find
    all the necessary paths. TK_XLIB_PATH has to be set only on Windows and 
    if you are using a source Tcl/Tk distribution.

<pre>
//Build the hybrid directory classes
VTK_USE_HYBRID:BOOL=ON

//Build the parallel directory classes
VTK_USE_PARALLEL:BOOL=ON

//Build the rendering classes used for displaying
VTK_USE_RENDERING:BOOL=ON
</pre>

   These modules are required by ParaView and should be turned on.

<pre>
//Build the patented directory classes, these classes are patented
// and may require a license to use
VTK_USE_PATENTED:BOOL=ON
</pre>

    The patented module is optional. Patented classes may require a license
    for commercial use. Check the individual header files for patent information.

<pre>
//use MPI (Message Passing Interface) library for parallel support
VTK_USE_MPI:BOOL=OFF

//What is the path where the file mpi.h can be found
MPI_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/local/mpi/include

//Where can one of the mpi or mpich libraries be found
MPI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/local/mpi/lib/libmpich.a
</pre>

    MPI is supported by VTK and ParaView but is optional. If this option is on,
    you will have to specify the MPI include path and the MPI library.

    Once VTK is built, compiling ParaView is simple. Run CMake as described
    before for VTK but using the ParaView source and binary directories and
    set the following cache entry:

<pre>
//What is the path where the file vtkConfigure.h can be found
VTK_BINARY_DIR:PATH=NOTFOUND
</pre>

    This entry should point to the VTK binary (build directory). This is where
    VTK's CMakeCache.txt and vtkConfigure.h are. Once this entry is set, CMake
    will read VTK's cache file for all the necessary information. You do not
    have to set any other options.

    Next build ParaView like you built VTK.
