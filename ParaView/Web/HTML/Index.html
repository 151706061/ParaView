<font size=5>Welcome</font> to ParaView, an application designed
with the need to visualize large data sets in mind. The goals of the ParaView project include the following:
<ul>
  <li>Develop an open-source, multi-platform visualization application.</li>
  <li>Support distributed computation models to process large data sets.</li>
  <li>Create an open, flexible, and intuitive user interface.</li>
  <li>Develop an extensible architecture based on open standards.</li>
</ul>

ParaView runs on distributed and shared memory parallel as well as single 
processor systems and has been succesfully tested on Windows, Linux and 
various Unix workstations and clusters. Under the hood, ParaView uses the
<a href="http://www.vtk.org">Visualization Toolkit</a> as the data
processing and rendering engine and has a user interface written using a 
unique blend of  <a href="http://www.tcl.tk">Tcl/Tk</a> and C++.
Please go  <a href="Features.html">here</a> for a detailed list of features.
<p>
<u><b>The Origins of ParaView</b></u><br> 
ParaView is being developed by <a href="http://www.kitware.com">Kitware</a> in
conjunction with Jim Ahrens of the 
<a href="http://www.acl.lanl.gov">Advanced Computing Laboratory</a>
at Los Alamos National Laboratory. ParaView is funded by the US Department 
of Energy  <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/asci/pse/dem/dem.html">ASCI Views</a> 
program as part of a three-year contract awarded to Kitware, Inc. by a 
consortium of  three National Labs - Los Alamos, Sandia, and Livermore.
The goal of the project is to develop scalable parallel processing tools 
with an emphasis on distributed memory implementations. The project includes 
parallel algorithms, infrastructure, I/O, support, and display devices. One 
significant feature of the contract is that all software developed is to be 
delivered open source. Hence ParaView is available as an open-source system.
