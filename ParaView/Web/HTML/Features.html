    <u><b>Visualization Capabilities:</u></b><p>

      <td>
       <ul>
       <li> Handles structured (uniform, non-uniform rectilinear grids as
            well as curvilinear grids), unstructured, polygonal and image data

            All processing operations (filters) produce datasets. This allows
            the user to either process further or to save as a data file the 
            result of every operation. For example, the user can extract a
            cut surface, reduce the number of points on this surface by
            masking  and apply glyphs (for example, vector arrows) to the
            result.

            <em>Contours and isosurfaces</em> can be extracted from all data 
            types using scalars or vector components. The results can be 
            colored by any other variable or processed further. When possible,
            structured data contours/isosurfaces are extracted with
            fast and efficient algorithms which make use of the special
            data layout.

            (currently arrows -<em>vector arrows</em>-, cones and spheres) 
            to the points in a dataset. The glyphs can be scaled 
            by scalars, vector component or vector magnitude and can be 
            oriented using a vector field.

            specifying a <em>threshold</em> criteria to exclude cells (all data
            types) and/or specifying a <em>VOI</em> (volume of interest -

            <a href="http://www.vtk.org">VTK</a> filter
            can be added by providing a simple XML description (VTK 
            provides hundreds of sources and filters, see VTK documentation

       </ul>
      </td>
     <tr>
     <tr>
      <td>
       <ul>
         <li> Compact user interface design. All 
              tools are located in the main window. This eliminates
              the need for large number of windows which are often
              difficult to locate on a cluttered desktop.
       </ul>
      </td>

       <ul>
         <li> <img align="right" src="../Art/manip.jpg">
              Allows changing the parameters of many 
              filters by directly interacting with the 3D view using
              <em>3D widgets (manipulators)</em>. For example, the
              user can manipulate the seed line of a streamtrace filter
              by clicking on a control point and dragging the line
              to the new location.

              Maintains interactive frame rates even when working with
              large data through the use of level-of-detail (LOD) models.
              The user determines the threshold (number of points) beyond
              which a reduced version of the model is displayed during
              interaction (the size of the model can also be adjusted).
              Once the interaction is over, the large model is rendered.

    <table border="0">
     <tbody>

     <tr>
      <td>
       <ul>
       <li> Runs parallel on distributed and shared memory systems
            using MPI. These include workstation clusters, visualization
            systems, large servers, supercomputers etc.
       </ul>
      </td>
     <tr>

       <tr>
      <td>
       <ul>
       <li> The user interface can be run either on the root MPI node
            or on a separate workstation using the client/server mode.
       </ul>
      </td>
     <tr>

     <tr>
      <td>
       <ul>
       <li> ParaView uses the <em>data parallel</em> model in which the data
            is broken into <em>pieces</em> to be processed by different
            processes. Most of the visualization algorithms function
            without any change when running in parallel. ParaView also
            supports <em>ghost levels</em> used to produce 
            <em>piece invariant </em> results. Ghost levels are points/cells
            shared between processes and are used by algorithms which require 
            neighborhood information.
       </ul>
      </td>
     <tr>

     <tr>
      <td>
       <ul> 
       <li> Supports both <em>distributed rendering</em> (where the results are
            rendered on each node  and composited later
            using the depth buffer), <em>local rendering</em> (where the 
            resulting polygons are collected on one node and rendered locally)
            and a combination of both (for example, the level-of-detail
            models can be rendered locally whereas the full model is
            rendered in a distributed manner). This provides scalable
            rendering for large data without sacrificing performance
            when working with smaller data.
       </ul>

     <tr>

     <tr>
      <td>

            manager. Support for Sandia's Ice-T library is under development.

    <u><b>Scripting and extensibility:</u></b><p>
    <table border="0">
     <tbody>

     <tr>
      <td>
       <ul>
       <li> ParaView is fully scriptable using the simple but powerful
            <a href="http://www.tcl.tk">Tcl</a> language. Every operation 
            has a corresponding script command. Every command executed
            during a session can be saved in a trace file which can
            be re-loaded to reproduce the session. Furthermore, since the 
            session file is simply a Tcl script, it can be edited/modified
            and loaded to obtain different results.
       </ul>
      </td>
     <tr>

     <tr>
      <td>
       <ul>
       <li> Additional modules can be added by either writing an XML
            description of the interface (since the XML interface is
            still being developed, it is not fully documented and is
            subject to change) or by writing special C++ sub-classes 
            of the main ParaView module (this is only needed for advanced 
            modules). The XML interface allows users/developers to add 
            their own VTK filters to ParaView without writing any special 
            code and/or re-compiling (ParaView can load shared Tcl wrapper 
            libraries at run time).
       </ul>
      </td>
     <tr>

     <tr>
      <td>
       <ul>
       <li> Since the user interface is written with 
            <a href="http://www.tcl.tk">Tk</a>, it can be modified and 
            extended at runtime either from the command prompt or by 
            loading a ParaView script. For example, it is possible to
            write a demonstation script which brings up a message window
            describing the current operation as well as allowing the
            user to interrupt the demo.
