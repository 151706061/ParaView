    <font size=5>Testing </font>plays a vital role in the ParaView
    development process. The 
    <a href="http://public.kitware.com/Dart">Dart</a> testing system
    is used to run tests and post results on the 
    <a href="http://www.paraview.org/Testing/Dashboard/MostRecentResults-Nightly/Dashboard.html">ParaView quality
    dashboard</a>. The dashboard is important to developers and users alike. 
    Developers use the dashboard to insure that code contributions 
    function correctly across multiple hardware and software platforms, 
    and are consistent with the existing code base. Users can view the 
    dashboard to determine the state of the system at a particular point 
    in time, possibly deferring a decision to update the software until 
    the code stabilizes.
    <p>

    <a href="http://www.paraview.org/Testing/Dashboard/MostRecentResults-Nightly/Dashboard.html">
    <img src=../Art/dashboard.jpg align=right border=0></a>The testing 
    dashboard is divided into several parts. The nightly builds reflect the
    state of the system at a particular point in time during the previous
    night (i.e., 11:30pm EST). The continuous builds run periodically in
    response to developer check-ins, and show the status of the code almost
    instantaneously. If errors occur during the continuous build, email is
    sent to the offending developer(s). Experimental builds may be submitted
    by anyone from any site, and are used to evaluate local changes to the
    software. Coverage refers to the percentage of the code that is actuallly
    executed. Purify is a memory-checking facility.<p>

    There are dozens of links corresponding to CVS checkins (called updates),
    previous days results, build warnings and erros, and the results of
    tests. These links can be followed to determine problems with the
    system, and to communicate with other developers and users.
