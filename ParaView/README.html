<h1><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<font size=5>Welcome</font> to ParaView, an application designed
with the need to visualize large data sets in mind. The goals of the ParaView project include the following:
<ul>
  <li>Develop an open-source, multi-platform visualization application.</li>
  <li>Support distributed computation models to process large data sets.</li>
  <li>Create an open, flexible, and intuitive user interface.</li>
  <li>Develop an extensible architecture based on open standards.</li>
</ul>
ParaView runs on distributed and shared memory parallel as well as single 
processor systems and has been succesfully tested on Windows, Linux and 
various Unix workstations and clusters. Under the hood, ParaView uses the
<a href="http://www.vtk.org">Visualization Toolkit</a> as the data
processing and rendering engine and has a user interface written using a 
unique blend of  <a href="http://www.tcl.tk">Tcl/Tk</a> and C++.
<p>
<u><b><a name="Origins">The Origins of ParaView</a></b></u><br> 
ParaView is being developed by <a href="http://www.kitware.com">Kitware</a> in
conjunction with Jim Ahrens of the 
<a href="http://www.acl.lanl.gov">Advanced Computing Laboratory</a>
at Los Alamos National Laboratory. ParaView is funded by the US Department 
of Energy  <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/asci/pse/dem/dem.html">ASCI Views</a> 
program as part of a three-year contract awarded to Kitware, Inc. by a 
consortium of  three National Labs - Los Alamos, Sandia, and Livermore.
The goal of the project is to develop scalable parallel processing tools 
with an emphasis on distributed memory implementations. The project includes 
parallel algorithms, infrastructure, I/O, support, and display devices. One 
significant feature of the contract is that all software developed is to be 
delivered open source. Hence ParaView is available as an open-source system.

            the user to either process further or to save as a data file the 
            result of every operation. For example, the user can extract a
            cut surface, reduce the number of points on this surface by
            masking  and apply glyphs (for example, vector arrows) to the
            result.

              <em>3D widgets (manipulators)</em>. For example, the
              user can manipulate the seed line of a streamtrace filter

              large data through the use of level-of-detail (LOD) models.
              The user determines the threshold (number of points) beyond
              which a reduced version of the model is displayed during
              interaction (the size of the model can also be adjusted).
              Once the interaction is over, the large model is rendered.

            processes. Most of the visualization algorithms function
            without any change when running in parallel. ParaView also
            supports <em>ghost levels</em> used to produce 
            <em>piece invariant </em> results. Ghost levels are points/cells
            shared between processes and are used by algorithms which require 
            neighborhood information.

      </td>
     <tr>

     <tr>
      <td>
       <ul> 
       <li> Supports both <em>distributed rendering</em> (where the results are
            rendered on each node  and composited later
            using the depth buffer), <em>local rendering</em> (where the 
            resulting polygons are collected on one node and rendered locally)
            and a combination of both (for example, the level-of-detail
            models can be rendered locally whereas the full model is
            rendered in a distributed manner). This provides scalable
            rendering for large data without sacrificing performance
            when working with smaller data.

            during a session can be saved in a trace file which can
            be re-loaded to reproduce the session. Furthermore, since the 
            session file is simply a Tcl script, it can be edited/modified

            description of the interface (since the XML interface is
            still being developed, it is not fully documented and is
            subject to change) or by writing special C++ sub-classes 
            of the main ParaView module (this is only needed for advanced 
            modules). The XML interface allows users/developers to add 
            their own VTK filters to ParaView without writing any special 
            code and/or re-compiling (ParaView can load shared Tcl wrapper

            loading a ParaView script. For example, it is possible to
            write a demonstation script which brings up a message window
            describing the current operation as well as allowing the

<h1><A NAME="Compiling">Compiling ParaView</a></h1>
<b><font size=3>Install CMake, VTK and Tcl/Tk</font></b><br>
To use ParaView, you will have to download and install VTK and CMake.
(VTK serves as the visualization engine; CMake is the build environment.) 
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<u><b>CMake</b></u> can be obtained from <a href="http://www.cmake.org">http://www.cmake.org</a>. See CMake documentation for installation
instructions.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<u><b>VTK</b></u> can be obtained downloaded from <a href="http://www.vtk.org">http://www.vtk.org</a> or can be obtained via CVS using the following procedure.
<p>
<b>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@public.kitware.com:/cvsroot/VTK login</b><br>
(respond with password vtk)
<p>
Follow this command by checking out the source code:<br>
<b>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@public.kitware.com:/cvsroot/VTK co -r ParaView-0-6 VTK</b>
<p>
(Note: CVS is a source code revision control system used by many participants 
in the open-source community. To use CVS, you must have it installed on your 
system. You may wish to use the 
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">Cygwin</a> tools on Windows
platforms, or <a href="http://www.wincvs.org">WinCVS</a> which provides 
a very nice GUI to CVS.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b><font size=3>Install </font></b> and build ParaView differently depending on the
operating system. Either way, you must build and/or install 
<a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a>, 
<a href="http://www.vtk.org/">VTK</a>, and 
<a href="ftp://tcl.activestate.com/pub/tcl/tcl8_3/">Tcl/Tk 8.3.2</a> 
prior to compiling and installing ParaView. Please note that ParaView
<em>requires</em> Tcl/Tk 8.3.2. It will not work with any other version.
<p>
<b><font size=3>Run CMake and Compile</font></b><br>
Once CMake and Tcl/Tk 8.3.2 are installed, you are ready to build VTK and
ParaView. We highly recommend reading the CMake documentation if you are not
familiar with CMake: <a href = "http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Documentation.html">http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Documentation.html</a>.
(You can skip the Developer's Guide if you are not going to work with
CMakeLists files.)
<p>
Detailed instructions  for configuring and compiling VTK can be found in
VTK/README.html. In summary, the VTK (and ParaView) build consists
of:
<ol>
<li> Running one of the CMake user interfaces </li>
<li> Changing configuration options  </li>
<li> Compiling (make on Unix, Visual Studio on Windows)</li>
</ol>

On Windows, you should use the CMakeSetup.exe application to setup
the VTK and ParaView build. On Unix/Linux, you should use the CMake wizard
(cmake -i) or the terminal interface (ccmake). See the CMake documentation
and VTK/README.html for details.
<p>
The following build options are the most important ones when building
VTK for ParaView. These are taken from real VTK configurations (from
both a Linux, gcc and a Windows, Visual C++ build, the values found
by CMake are shown inside square brackets). A brief description of 
each entry is given here to help users configure and build VTK with the 
right settings. When a value in the following list is optional, it is 
cleared described as such.  Otherwise, the entry must be set to a proper 
value. Note that some entries are marked (Unix/Linux only) or (Windows only) 
and are only relevant to the given operating system(s). Usually, CMake 
will automatically set all of the other build options to appropriate values. 
However, if a package which is needed by VTK is in an unusual place or if 
it encounters something unexpected, CMake might not be able to set 
an option/setting correctly and  you might get errors when compiling VTK. 
If you are not sure about what the  problem might be, you can contact 
the <a href="http://www.paraview.org/HTML/MailingList.html">
ParaView mailing list</a>.
<p>
<pre>
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS [OFF]
</pre>

If you are going to run ParaView in a distributed environment with
MPI, we recommend keeping BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF. This way, your ParaView
executable will not depend on many VTK and ParaView shared libraries
and you will have to distribute fewer shared libraries over the nodes
of your distributed environment. Other shared libraries (for example, tcl 
and tk libraries are usually shared) which ParaView is linked against will
have to exist (and in the path) on all nodes so that ParaView can find them
when running.

<pre>

(Unix/Linux only)
OPENGL_INCLUDE_PATH [/usr/include]

OPENGL_LIBRARY [/usr/lib/libGL.so]
</pre>

VTK requires OpenGL. On Windows, this library is almost always found
automatically by CMake. On Unix/Linux, you might need to set these values
if CMake does not find them when first run. Mesa include files and library
can be used instead of OpenGL ones without having to set any other options.

<pre>

TCL_INCLUDE_PATH [/usr/local/include]

TCL_LIBRARY [/usr/local/lib/libtcl8.2.so]

TK_INCLUDE_PATH [/usr/local/include]

TK_LIBRARY [/usr/local/lib/libtk8.2.so]

VTK_WRAP_TCL [ON]
</pre>

ParaView requires that VTK is built with Tcl/Tk bindings (VTK_WRAP_TCL
has to be on). Furthermore, it requires that Tcl/Tk 8.3.2 is used. Any 
other version of Tcl/Tk will not work. The cache values for the Tcl/Tk 
include paths and libraries have to be set appropriately. On Windows, we 
recommend that you install Tcl/Tk 8.3.2 binaries using the default path 
(C:/Program Files/Tcl/lib). In this case, CMake will automatically find
all the necessary paths. 

<pre>

VTK_USE_HYBRID [ON]

VTK_USE_PARALLEL [ON]

VTK_USE_RENDERING [ON]
</pre>

These modules are required by ParaView and should be turned on.
<p>
<pre>
VTK_USE_PATENTED [ON]
</pre>

The patented module is optional. Patented classes may require a license
for commercial use. Check the individual header files for patent information.

<pre>

VTK_USE_MPI [OFF]

MPI_INCLUDE_PATH [/usr/local/mpi/include]

MPI_LIBRARY [/usr/local/mpi/lib/libmpich.a]
</pre>

MPI is supported by VTK and ParaView but is optional. If this option is on,
you will have to specify the MPI include path and the MPI library.

Once VTK is built, compiling ParaView is simple. Run CMake as described
before for VTK but using the ParaView source and binary directories and
set the following value:

<pre>

VTK_BINARY_PATH [NOTFOUND]
</pre>

This entry should point to the VTK binary (build directory). This is where
VTK's CMakeCache.txt and vtkConfigure.h are. Once this entry is set, CMake
will read VTK's cache file for all the necessary information. You do not
have to set any other options.

Next build ParaView like you built VTK.
