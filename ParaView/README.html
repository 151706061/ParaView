<h1><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<font size=5>Welcome</font> to ParaView, an open-source, multi-platform, 
parallel scientific  visualization application. Although it can be run on 
a single processor,  ParaView is specifically designed to run on distributed 
parallel computers. ParaView has been succesfully tested on Windows and Linux 
workstations, clusters and SGI Origin 2000 systems. ParaView is a turnkey 
application  written using the  <a href="http://www.visualizationtoolkit.org">
Visualization Toolkit</a> and it has a framework based on a unique blend of 
Tcl/Tk and C++. 
<p>
<font size=5>ParaView </font> is an extensible, open-source visualization system
designed for parallel computing environments. It is built on the open-source
<a href="http://www.visualizationtoolkit.org">VTK</a> software. It uses data
streaming to process large datasets, supports parallel implementations of common
algorithms, and uses parallel tree-composite rendering for a completely parallel
solution.
<p>

<u><b><a name="Origins">The Origins of ParaView</a></b></u><br> 
ParaView is being developed as part of a three-year contract awarded to
Kitware, Inc. by a consortium of three National Labs:  Los Alamos,
Sandia, and Livermore. The goal of the project is to develop scalable
parallel processing tools with an emphasis on distributed memory
implementations. The project includes parallel algorithms,
infrastructure, I/O, support, and display devices. In addition, the
turn-key application, ParaView, is being developed as part of this
contract. One significant feature of the contract is that all software
developed is to be delivered open source. Hence ParaView is available
as an open-source system.
<p>
<u><b><a name="Features">Features</a></b></u><br>

<h1><A NAME="Compiling">Compiling ParaView</a></h1>
<b><font size=3>Install CMake, VTK and Tcl/Tk</font></b><br>
To use ParaView, you will have to download and install VTK and CMake.
(VTK serves as the visualization engine; CMake is the build environment.) 
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<u><b>CMake</b></u> can be obtained from <a href="http://public.kitware.com/CMake">http://public.kitware.com/CMake</a>. See CMake documentation for installation
instructions.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<u><b>VTK</b></u> can be obtained downloaded from <a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK">http://public.kitware.com/VTK</a> or can be obtained via CVS using the following procedure.
<p>
<b>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@public.kitware.com:/cvsroot/VTK login</b><br>
(respond with password vtk)
<p>
Follow this command by checking out the source code:<br>
<b>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@public.kitware.com:/cvsroot/VTK co -r ParaView-0-2 VTK</b>
<p>
(Note: CVS is a source code revision control system used by many participants 
in the open-source community. To use CVS, you must have it installed on your 
system. You may wish to use the 
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">Cygwin</a> tools on Windows
platforms, or <a href="http://www.wincvs.org">WinCVS</a> which provides 
a very nice GUI to CVS.
<p>

<p>

<b><font size=3>Install </font></b> and build ParaView differently depending on the
operating system. Either way, you must build and/or install 
<a href="http://public.kitware.com/CMake">CMake</a>, 
<a href="http://www.visualizationtoolkit.org/">VTK</a>, and 
<a href="ftp://tcl.activestate.com/pub/tcl/tcl8_2/">Tcl/Tk 8.2.3</a> 
prior to compiling and installing ParaView. Please note that ParaView
<em>requires</em> Tcl/Tk 8.2.3. It will not work with any other version.
<p>
<b><font size=3>Run CMake and Compile</font></b><br>
Once CMake and Tcl/Tk 8.2.3 are installed, you are ready to build VTK and
ParaView. We highly recommend reading the CMake documentation if you are not
familiar with CMake: <a href = "http://public.kitware.com/CMake/HTML/Documentation.html">http://public.kitware.com/CMake/HTML/Documentation.html</a>.
(You can skip the Developer's Guide if you are not going to work with
CMakeLists files.)
<p>
Detailed instructions  for configuring and compiling VTK can be found in
VTK/README.html. In summary, the VTK (and ParaView) build consists
of:
<ol>
<li> Running one of the CMake user interfaces </li>
<li> Changing configuration options  </li>
<li> Compiling (make on Unix, Visual Studio on Windows)</li>
</ol>

On Windows, you should use the CMakeSetup.exe application to setup
the VTK and ParaView build. On Unix/Linux, you should use the CMake wizard
(cmake -i) or the terminal interface (ccmake). See the CMake documentation
and VTK/README.html for details.
<p>
The following build options are the most important ones when building
VTK for ParaView. These are taken from real VTK configurations (from
both a Linux, gcc and a Windows, Visual C++ build, the values found
by CMake are shown inside square brackets). A brief description of 
each entry is given here to help users configure and build VTK with the 
right settings. When a value in the following list is optional, it is 
cleared described as such.  Otherwise, the entry must be set to a proper 
value. Note that some entries are marked (Unix/Linux only) or (Windows only) 
and are only relevant to the given operating system(s). Usually, CMake 
will automatically set all of the other build options to appropriate values. 
However, if a package which is needed by VTK is in an unusual place or if 
it encounters something unexpected, CMake might not be able to set 
an option/setting correctly and  you might get errors when compiling VTK. 
If you are not sure about what the  problem might be, you can contact 
the <a href="http://public.kitware.com/ParaView/HTML/MailingList.html">
ParaView mailing list</a>.
<p>
<pre>
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS [OFF]
</pre>

If you are going to run ParaView in a distributed environment with
MPI, we recommend keeping BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF. This way, your ParaView
executable will not depend on many VTK and ParaView shared libraries
and you will have to distribute fewer shared libraries over the nodes
of your distributed environment. Other shared libraries (for example, tcl 
and tk libraries are usually shared) which ParaView is linked against will
have to exist (and in the path) on all nodes so that ParaView can find them
when running.

<pre>

(Unix/Linux only)
OPENGL_INCLUDE_PATH [/usr/include]

OPENGL_LIBRARY [/usr/lib/libGL.so]
</pre>

VTK requires OpenGL. On Windows, this library is almost always found
automatically by CMake. On Unix/Linux, you might need to set these values
if CMake does not find them when first run. Mesa include files and library
can be used instead of OpenGL ones without having to set any other options.

<pre>

TCL_INCLUDE_PATH [/usr/local/include]

TCL_LIBRARY [/usr/local/lib/libtcl8.2.so]

TK_INCLUDE_PATH [/usr/local/include]

TK_LIBRARY [/usr/local/lib/libtk8.2.so]

VTK_WRAP_TCL [ON]
</pre>

ParaView requires that VTK is built with Tcl/Tk bindings (VTK_WRAP_TCL
has to be on). Furthermore, it requires that Tcl/Tk 8.2.3 is used. Any 
other version of Tcl/Tk will not work. The cache values for the Tcl/Tk 
include paths and libraries have to be set appropriately. On Windows, we 
recommend that you install Tcl/Tk 8.2.3 binaries using the default path 
(C:/Program Files/Tcl/lib). In this case, CMake will automatically find
all the necessary paths. 

<pre>

VTK_USE_HYBRID [ON]

VTK_USE_PARALLEL [ON]

VTK_USE_RENDERING [ON]
</pre>

These modules are required by ParaView and should be turned on.
<p>
<pre>
VTK_USE_PATENTED [ON]
</pre>

The patented module is optional. Patented classes may require a license
for commercial use. Check the individual header files for patent information.

<pre>

VTK_USE_MPI [OFF]

MPI_INCLUDE_PATH [/usr/local/mpi/include]

MPI_LIBRARY [/usr/local/mpi/lib/libmpich.a]
</pre>

MPI is supported by VTK and ParaView but is optional. If this option is on,
you will have to specify the MPI include path and the MPI library.

Once VTK is built, compiling ParaView is simple. Run CMake as described
before for VTK but using the ParaView source and binary directories and
set the following value:

<pre>

VTK_BINARY_PATH [NOTFOUND]
</pre>

This entry should point to the VTK binary (build directory). This is where
VTK's CMakeCache.txt and vtkConfigure.h are. Once this entry is set, CMake
will read VTK's cache file for all the necessary information. You do not
have to set any other options.

Next build ParaView like you built VTK.
